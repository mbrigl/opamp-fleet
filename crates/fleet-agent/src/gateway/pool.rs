//! The upstream Connection Pool (ADR-0034): *m* WebSocket connections carrying *n* Agents.
//!
//! Two rules do the work. The pool **grows lazily** to its configured cap — a Gateway in front of
//! three Agents holds three connections, not ten — and an Agent is **stuck to its connection** by
//! `instance_uid` for as long as that connection lives. Nothing in the protocol requires the
//! stickiness; it keeps one Agent's `sequence_num` stream and its `ReportFullState` exchanges on a
//! single socket, which is what makes a fleet debuggable.
//!
//! The pool is WebSocket-only, and the configuration refuses anything else at startup: a polling
//! upstream could not carry the Server's pushes to the Agents behind the Gateway.
//!
//! Any live connection carries any downstream Agent: every one is opened with this Gateway's own
//! identity and nothing else, so nothing on it depends on the peer an Agent came through
//! (ADR-0034 clause 7).
