//! The Gateway's package cache (ADR-0028 clauses 42 to 48): each uploaded artifact the Gateway
//! relays an offer of is fetched from the Server once, with the Gateway's own certificate, and
//! passed on only to a downstream host whose Agent it relayed that offer to.
//!
//! What is kept here:
//! - the **bindings**: each `instance_uid` to the host of the first report for it since the
//!   Gateway started, as the Server binds on first report (ADR-0022 clause 7);
//! - the **offers**: per `instance_uid`, the Server-hosted artifacts its last recorded
//!   `packages_available` named, indexed by host;
//! - the **held** artifacts, one file per stored copy under `<state_dir>/gateway-packages`, verified
//!   against the offered hash before it is renamed into place, and the room reserved for the
//!   fetches in flight and counted for the files being deleted;
//! - what each artifact's fetch came to: in flight, failed (not repeated until the artifact newly
//!   appears in an offer), too large (not repeated at all), and whether a request may still
//!   trigger one refetch of it under the current offer.
//!
//! What a downstream peer may fetch is decided from the bindings and the offers alone, by the host
//! its certificate names. A request never waits for a fetch: while one runs it is answered `503`
//! with `Retry-After`, and everything else the route does not serve is answered with one `404`.
//! No file operation runs while the shared state is locked.
