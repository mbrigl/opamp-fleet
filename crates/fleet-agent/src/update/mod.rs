//! The Client's own Agent accepts a package like any Supervisor's, but nothing outlives the

//! [`SelfUpdater`] stages, proves and points at the new version. After it, the next process either
//! commits that version or rolls back. This module holds the port and the state the Engine keeps
//! about it: whether self-update is armed, whether the Server has answered this process, and
//! whether the run has to end. The adapter on the ADR-0021 version directories is
//! [`installer`].
