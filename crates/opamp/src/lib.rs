//! The OpAMP communication layer (ADR-0009, ADR-0024). Without features it is the wire layer: the
//! protobuf types generated from the specification, the WebSocket framing, the endpoint's body
//! rules, `InstanceUid`, and the attribute keys an `AgentDescription` is read by.
//!
//! It holds what the specification defines and nothing else, so it serves any OpAMP server or
//! agent written in Rust. Two features add each side on top, end to end, and neither is on by
//! default:
//!
//! - `client` — `opamp::client`: an Agent's protocol state machine and its connection over either
//!   transport, TLS included;
//! - `server` — `opamp::server`: one server endpoint for both transports around a handler, and the
//!   listener it is served on.
//!
//! Both build their TLS with `opamp::tls` from the material the application hands them. The crate
//! reads no file and no configuration format.
//!
//! This crate's version follows the specification's: `0.20.x` is generated from opamp-spec
//! `v0.20.0`, which [`BASELINE`] states.
