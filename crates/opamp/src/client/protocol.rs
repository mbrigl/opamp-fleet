//! One Agent's OpAMP state machine, as the specification defines it (ADR-0024).
//!
//! It decides **which** fields a report carries — a full snapshot or only what changed, and only
//! what the Server's Capability Set licenses — and settles what a reply means for the protocol:
//! capabilities, flags, error responses, a reassigned identity, commands. **What** a report holds,
//! and what to do with a configuration, a connection-settings offer or a package offer, is the
//! application's: it supplies the content through [`ReportContent`] and is handed the rest as a
//! [`Received`].
//!
//! It performs no I/O and needs only `opamp` and the standard library, so a program that brings its
//! own I/O can drive it directly; [`ws`](crate::client::ws) and [`http`](crate::client::http) are the drivers this
//! crate offers on top of it.
