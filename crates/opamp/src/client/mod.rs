//! An OpAMP agent's side of the protocol (ADR-0024): one Agent's state machine, and the
//! connection that carries any number of them to a Server. Behind the `client` feature.
//!
//! - [`protocol`] — the state machine, without I/O: which fields a report carries, and what a reply
//!   means for the protocol.
//! - [`ws`] and [`http`] — the two transports, each a driver for one connection: connecting with
//!   backoff, the heartbeat or poll interval, framing, the message size limit in both directions,
//!   the 1009 close, throttling, and the goodbye.
//! - [`connection`] — one connection described once, from which the transport, its TLS, its HTTP
//!   client and its headers are built; the probe that proves offered settings.
//!
//! What the Agents report and what is done with a reply is the application's: it implements
//! [`Session`], and a driver calls it. Which material a connection uses is the application's too:
//! it fills in a [`Connection`], and this module builds the rest.
