//! One OpAMP server endpoint, for every surface that speaks the Server side of the protocol
//! (ADR-0024). Behind the `server` feature.
//!
//! This crate carries the communication and nothing else: it tells a WebSocket upgrade from a
//! plain-HTTP exchange as the specification describes, applies the media type, gzip and the
//! receive limit on both transports, frames WebSocket messages, closes with 1009 on an oversized
//! one, and never puts an oversized reply on the wire. What a message *means* is the
//! application's: it implements [`Handler`], and the endpoint calls it.
//!
//! [`router`] hands out an axum [`Router`], so a surface can add its admission layers and
//! neighbouring routes. [`listen`] serves the result, with its TLS and its bounds on connection
//! setup.
