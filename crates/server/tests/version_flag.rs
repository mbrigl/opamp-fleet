//! `server --version` states the version this build actually is (ADR-0009, ADR-0026).
//!
//! The regression: it printed `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, which is the number in `Cargo.toml` and so the
//! release this build is *heading for* — a development build claimed to be the release, and the
//! commit it came from appeared nowhere. The Client had reported the baked version all along, so
//! the two binaries of one workspace disagreed about what version they were.
