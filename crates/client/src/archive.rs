//! Unpacking a package artifact (ADR-0018).
//!
//! An upstream release is an archive — `opentelemetry-collector-releases` publishes `.tar.gz` and
//! never a bare binary — so the artifact a Supervisor is handed is often a container holding the
//! program rather than the program itself. Nothing between the artifact's author and this host
//! repacks it (ADR-0018), which is what lets an Agent verify the very hash the release published;
//! the price is that the Agent is the end that has to open it.
//!
//! Two rules keep opening someone else's archive from becoming a way in:
//!
//! - **The archive chooses as little as it can.** For a single-file package it chooses nothing:
//!   exactly one member is extracted, to a destination this Client picked, so a member named
//!   `../../etc/cron.d/x` writes to that destination like any other and there is no traversal to
//!   defend against. A tree (ADR-0023) cannot work that way — its members keep their own relative
//!   paths — so every path is validated by [`safe_member_path`] *before a byte is written*, and one
//!   member this Client will not write refuses the whole archive.
//! - **The output is bounded.** Extraction stops at [`MAX_UNPACKED_BYTES`] — for a tree, across all
//!   its members, and at [`MAX_TREE_MEMBERS`] members — so an archive that expands without end
//!   fills a temporary file up to that limit and then fails, rather than a disk.
