//! What `service-manager` leaves undone on Windows: the recovery actions that make ADR-0010's
//! "restart on failure" true there as well, the display name of ADR-0030, and the logon account
//! of ADR-0062.
//!
//! On systemd and launchd the restart policy handed to `service-manager` is written straight into
//! the unit (`Restart=on-failure`) or the plist (`KeepAlive{SuccessfulExit:false}`). Its Windows
//! backend is the `sc.exe` wrapper, whose `install` matches on the policy **only to log a
//! warning** — *"sc.exe does not support automatic restart policies through 'sc create'; service
//! '…' will not restart automatically"* — and registers no recovery actions at all. A Windows
//! Client therefore never came back from any failure, which contradicts ADR-0010 on one of its
//! three platforms.
//!
//! Two calls close that, both on the `windows-service` crate already used for the SCM runtime
//! shim, so nothing new is depended on:
//!
//! 1. **`update_failure_actions`** — one `Restart` action after a delay. The SCM repeats the last
//!    action for every further failure, so a single entry with no reset period is the unbounded
//!    retry that `RestartPolicy::OnFailure { max_retries: None }` asks for.
//! 2. **`set_failure_actions_on_non_crash_failures`** — without it the recovery actions run only
//!    when the process dies *without* reporting `SERVICE_STOPPED`. A service that stops cleanly
//!    while reporting a non-zero exit code — a Client that failed to start on a bad configuration,
//!    or one deliberately ending its run — is otherwise treated as a clean stop and never
//!    restarted. The flag is false by default.
//!
//! The display name is the third gap. The backend's `sc create` sets `displayname=` to the service
//! name, so the Windows services list would read `supervisor` where ADR-0010 promised
//! *"OpAMP Fleet Client (<instance>)"* — a promise never actually kept. It is set afterwards with
//! `sc.exe config`, deliberately **not** with the crate's `Service::change_config`: that call maps
//! onto `ChangeServiceConfigW` with every field supplied from a `ServiceInfo`, so setting one field
//! means restating the executable path, the launch arguments, the start type and the account
//! exactly as registered — and getting any of them wrong rewrites the registration rather than the
//! name. `sc config` changes the one field it is given and leaves the rest alone. This is also how
//! the service was created: the backend is the `sc.exe` wrapper.
//!
//! The **description** is a fourth, and is not the display name under another word: the services
//! list has a Description column of its own, nothing that registers the service fills it, and a
//! service with a display name still shows an empty one. It is set the same way, with the one
//! `sc.exe` verb that carries it.
//!
//! Everything here is a no-op on Unix.
