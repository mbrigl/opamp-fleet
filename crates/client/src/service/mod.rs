//! Everything that makes the Client an OS service (ADR-0010) lives in this module: the daemon
//! runtime with graceful shutdown ([`runtime`]), the versioned install layout ([`layout`]), and
//! the cross-platform service lifecycle ([`manager`]). The Windows SCM runtime shim joins as a
//! `cfg(windows)` submodule.
//!
//! The [`ServiceControl`] trait is the deliberate seam: a future self-update stops, switches, and
//! starts the service through these three calls only, never through service internals.
