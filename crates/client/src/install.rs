//! Turning a verified artifact into a runnable program on disk.
//!
//! The Client installs programs in two quite different ways: a Managed Process is replaced by a
//! Supervisor that outlives it (ADR-0015), and the Client's own binary is staged beside the running
//! version and reached by a restart (ADR-0020). Those two lifecycles are genuinely different and
//! stay where they are — `supervisor::process` owns the first, [`crate::selfupdate`] the second.
//!
//! What they share is the step in the middle, and they shared it by writing it twice: unpack the
//! artifact — raw bytes or an archive holding the program (ADR-0018) — to a path, make the result
//! executable, and cope with the kernel refusing to exec a file that was written moments ago. That
//! is what lives here, so each rule is stated once.
