//! The Client's own log on disk, while it runs as a service (ADR-0041).
//!
//! The Windows SCM discards a service's stderr, so a Client installed there had no readable log at
//! all; systemd and launchd do capture it, and the file is written on those platforms too so that
//! "where are the logs" has one answer everywhere — including in a container, where neither is
//! present. In the foreground nothing is written: somebody is reading stderr there.
//!
//! This is not the OTLP own-logs bridge (ADR-0036) under another name. That one needs a Server that
//! is already reachable, which is exactly what a bad `client.toml`, an unusable certificate, or a
//! refused endpoint is not.
//!
//! **The destination is not known when logging starts.** `tracing` takes one subscriber per process
//! and `main` installs it before the command line is parsed, so the instance — and with it the state
//! directory — does not exist yet. Rather than a second reloadable layer, the file layer is
//! installed from the start with [`LogFile`] as its writer, which discards everything until
//! [`open`] hands it somewhere to write. Events logged before that still reach stderr.
