//! The Client replacing its own binary (ADR-0020).
//!
//! Updating a Managed Process is done by a Supervisor that outlives it (ADR-0015): stop, swap,
//! restart, watch, roll back. Nothing here outlives anything — the process that installs the
//! package is the process that has to exit for the install to take effect. So the work is split
//! across the restart, and this module owns both halves:
//!
//! **Before.** [`install`] stages the new version *beside* the running one in the ADR-0010 layout,
//! proves it by running it (`client self-check`), records an [`UpdateMarker`], and moves the
//! `current` pointer. Nothing is overwritten, so the version being replaced is still on disk and
//! the rollback is a pointer move rather than a download.
//!
//! **After.** [`on_start`] runs before anything else in a fresh process. It finds the marker the
//! previous process left, counts the attempt, and either lets the run proceed on probation — until
//! [`commit`] declares the new version good — or gives up and points `current` back.
//!
//! The probe and the counter cover different failures and neither covers both. A binary that
//! cannot exec at all never reaches [`on_start`] to count anything, which is why it is proved
//! before the pointer moves; a binary that starts and then will not stay up cannot be caught by a
//! probe that only watched it print a line, which is why the counter exists.
