//! The `collector` plugin: the Collector Supervisor (ADR-0011). It owns an OpenTelemetry
//! Collector: spawns the configured binary with one `--config` flag per written config-map
//! entry — the Collector merges multiple configs itself, so no YAML is touched here — and
//! restarts it when a new remote configuration arrives. Until a configuration exists nothing
//! runs and the Agent reports "awaiting configuration".
//!
//! A Collector carrying the `opampextension` additionally reports its own description, health,
//! and effective configuration to the Supervisor Endpoint; one without it is observed from the
//! outside. Either way it is the same plugin (goal 16 versus plain supervision).
