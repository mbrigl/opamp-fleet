//! The Client updating itself, end to end (ADR-0020, ADR-0010) — the one path in this project
//! whose failure takes a host out of the fleet's reach for good, and the only major feature that
//! had no test across the process boundary.
//!
//! Everything real except the service manager: the real Server armed with a package store, the
//! real Client binary running from a real ADR-0010 install layout, installing a real artifact over
//! itself. The restart the Client asks for by exiting is performed *here* — that is precisely the
//! step no CI can delegate to systemd, launchd, or the SCM, and standing in for it is what makes
//! the rest observable.
//!
//! The contract under test is the fleet's, not the mechanism's: whatever number of restarts it
//! takes, the Server must end up being told the new version is `Installed`. Asserting the step
//! count instead would freeze an implementation detail that ADR-0020 deliberately leaves open.
//!
//! Runs on all three platforms, because the pointer is the part of ADR-0010 that differs between
//! them — a symlink on Unix, a junction on Windows — and it is precisely what a self-update moves
//! while the Client is running through it. A test that only ever moved the symlink would leave the
//! platform whose mechanism is the unusual one entirely unasserted.
