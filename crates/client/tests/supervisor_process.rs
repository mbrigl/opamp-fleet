//! The supervision `Runner` (ADR-0011) across everything it does *to a host*: spawn and watchdog,
//! the health-gated apply, the binary swap and its rollback (ADR-0015), and the tree install
//! (ADR-0023).
//!
//! An integration test rather than a unit test, and that is the reason ADR-0024 exists: these cases
//! need the supervision core **and** a real program to spawn, and Cargo hands a test the path of a
//! helper binary "only … when building an integration test or benchmark". As unit tests inside a
//! binary crate they could reach no such program, so they ran `/bin/sh` scripts and were gated to
//! Unix — leaving the swap, the gate and the rollback asserted by nothing on the two platforms
//! where a failed install is hardest to inspect.
//!
//! The two stubs are the vocabulary: [`stub_agent`] stays up until it is killed, [`stub_crasher`]
//! exits at once. Which one's *bytes* an artifact carries is what decides whether an install
//! survives its grace — the same thing the shell scripts used to say, in a form all three platforms
//! can execute.
