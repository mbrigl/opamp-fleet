//! The MSI's custom-action command lines, parsed the way Windows will parse them
//! (`packaging/windows/supervisor.wxs`, ADR-0046).
//!
//! Regression test, and since ADR-0084 clause 3 also a guard on how the hazard was retired.
//!
//! `[INSTALLFOLDER]` always resolves with a trailing backslash, and the C runtime that builds a
//! process's argv treats a backslash before a quote as an escaped, literal quote — so
//! `--root &quot;[INSTALLFOLDER]&quot;` did not end the argument at the closing quote. The root
//! swallowed the rest of the command line, `service install` staged into an impossible path, and
//! every MSI install died with error 1722 ("A program run as part of the setup did not finish as
//! expected").
//!
//! The MSI no longer passes a root at all: `Program Files` holds the payload and the layout goes
//! under `%ProgramData%`, so no directory property reaches a command line. That is the stronger
//! fix — a doubled backslash is one edit away from being undoubled, while an argument that is not
//! there cannot be mis-split. Both facts are asserted below, because the day someone reintroduces
//! `--root` here, they reintroduce error 1722 with it.
//!
//! This test formats each ExeCommand the way msiexec does, splits it under the CRT's documented
//! rules, and feeds the result to the real CLI parser — pure string handling, so the Windows
//! failure is caught on every platform.
