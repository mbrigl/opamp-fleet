//! The Client's own log file, driven through the real binary (ADR-0041).
//!
//! The unit tests cover the writer and the rotation; what they cannot show is the thing the
//! decision exists for — that a process started the way a service manager starts it actually
//! produces a readable file, and that a process started by a person does not.
//!
//! **Unix only, and not because Windows does not matter — it is the platform that does.** On
//! Windows `run --service` enters the SCM dispatcher, which fails outside a real service context,
//! so the equivalent proof there belongs to `service_smoke.rs`, which installs a service for real.
