# Changelog

Operator-facing changes to the Server and the Client — what a running deployment has to be told
about, in particular anything that must be edited or moved before an upgrade. The reasoning behind
each change lives in the ADR it names ([`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/)); this file says only what to do.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are the ones
[ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-version-derivation-and-baking.md) derives from `version/*` tags.

> **Where this file starts.** Entries begin with ADR-0021. The work between `version/0.1.0` and
> that point — package delivery, Selector-targeted packages and Configurations, the Client's own
> self-update, and the rest — is not backfilled here; it is in the git log and in the ADRs.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed — breaking

- **`accepts_packages` is no longer a `[[supervisor]]` key** and a configuration still carrying it
  **fails at startup**. Whether a Managed Process takes Server-offered package updates is now
  decided by how its program is named
  ([ADR-0021](docs/adr/0021-supervisor-directory-and-path-implied-package-consent.md)):

  | `binary` / `command` | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | a bare file name (`otelcol-contrib`) | the program lives in `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/program/`, a directory the Client owns — it **takes** package updates |
  | an absolute path (`/usr/local/bin/otelcol`) | the machine's program — it is supervised but never written to |
  | anything else (`./x`, `bin/x`) | a startup error |

  **To keep updates working on a host that had `accepts_packages = true`:** move the program into
  `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/program/`, reduce the configured path to its bare file name, and delete
  the `accepts_packages` line. **To stop at supervision instead:** delete the line and leave the
  absolute path. Either way it is one edit per host — the Client will not start until it is made.

  This also fixes the case that motivated the change: with an absolute path into a directory the
  Client cannot write (`/usr/local/bin` under a non-root Client), an update could be configured but
  never succeed, and it failed at rollout time on every matched host rather than at startup on one.

  **On Windows, "absolute" means the path names a drive.** `\Program Files\otelcol\otelcol.exe`
  carries a root but no drive, so it resolves against whichever drive the process happens to be
  on — it used to be spawned that way and is now refused at startup, with a message saying what is
  missing. Write `C:\Program Files\otelcol\otelcol.exe`.

- **A bare program name is no longer looked up in `$PATH`.** `command = "fluent-bit"` used to mean
  "find it on the path" and now names a file in that Supervisor's `program/` directory. This is
  silent — the process starts from a different path rather than erroring — so check any block whose
  program is not an absolute path. The startup log states, per Supervisor, which program it resolved
  to and whether packages are accepted.

### Added

- **`supervisor_dir`** (optional, top-level) places the per-Supervisor directories; the default is
  `<state_dir>/supervisors`, which is where they have always been. Set it to keep the Managed
  Processes' programs off a `noexec` mount, or off a volume sized for state rather than for a few
  hundred megabytes of Collector. Moving it on a running host leaves the old tree behind —
  `instance-uid` included — so each Supervisor re-registers as a **new** Agent on the Server;
  nothing migrates automatically.

- **`${supervisor_dir}` and `${config_dir}` in a `command` Supervisor's `args`, `working_dir`, and
  `env` values** ([ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-supervisor-path-placeholders-in-process-arguments.md)),
  so a Foreign Agent's command line is derived from the same place the Client derives it from:

  ```toml
  args = ["-c", "${config_dir}/fluent-bit-conf"]
  ```

  An absolute path still works and is still wrong the moment `supervisor_dir` moves or the
  Supervisor is renamed — the process then starts happily on a file nobody writes to, with nothing
  reporting a problem. The shipped example carried exactly that mistake and now uses the
  placeholder. Any other `${…}` is passed to the process untouched, so an agent's own variable
  syntax keeps working; the flip side is that a misspelled placeholder is handed over rather than
  refused. The program itself (`binary`, `command`) is never substituted.

### Changed

- A Supervisor's package downloads are staged in its own directory
  (`<supervisor_dir>/<name>/packages/`) instead of `<state_dir>/packages/`, which the Client's own
  Agent keeps using. Any `*.staged` file left in the old location by an interrupted download is
  orphaned and can be deleted.
- A package artifact that is a bare program is now **moved** into place rather than copied, saving a
  second full write of it. An artifact that is an archive is still unpacked, so an upstream
  Collector release (`.tar.gz`) is unaffected.
