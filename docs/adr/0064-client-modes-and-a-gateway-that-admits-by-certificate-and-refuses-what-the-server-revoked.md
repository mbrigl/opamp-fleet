# ADR-0064: One Client binary with two composable modes, carrying n Agents over m connections, and a Gateway that admits by client certificate over mutual TLS 1.3 and refuses what the Server revoked

- **Status:** ⚪ superseded by [ADR-0071](0071-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)
- **Date:** 2026-10-06
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** crates/fleet-agent/src/gateway/, crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/endpoint.rs, the [gateway] configuration section, and every place either end keeps per-Agent state
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-0055](0055-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-refuses-what-the-server-revoked.md)

## Context

Supersedes [ADR-0055](0055-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-refuses-what-the-server-revoked.md)
because the Agent plane no longer has a fleet credential:
[ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md), which supersedes ADR-0039, admits by
a client certificate alone, and rests on the specification's Gateway Mode paragraph and goal 15 as
amended alongside it. ADR-0055 forwarded each downstream peer's `Authorization` upstream untouched,
so the Server checked a credential end to end, and the implementation partitioned the upstream pool
by that credential.
With no credential there is nothing to forward and nothing to partition by. That changes the
substance of a downstream Agent's admission: the Gateway's downstream handshake against the fleet's
client CA, together with the Server's revocation list, is now the whole of it, and the Server
relies on a marked Gateway's handshake instead of judging a proof of its own. The rest of the
decision stands as it was.

The [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md) asks the client side to cover three shapes: supervise
local processes, serve a Collector that speaks OpAMP itself, and act as a gateway that carries many
other Clients upstream over a small Connection Pool (goal 15). They are not three peers.

**Supervising and serving an OpAMP-speaking Collector are inseparable.** The Collector's
`opampextension` is an OpAMP *client only*; it must be given something to connect to. The natural
counterpart is the Supervisor that owns that Collector, because it holds the configuration to hand
down and the upstream connection to relay onto. An endpoint without a Supervisor has nothing to
relay to, and a Supervisor without one cannot manage an extension-carrying Collector. Gatewaying for
other machines is genuinely independent: a host may supervise, gateway, or do both.

**The protocol provides for multiplexing.** The Baseline documents `ServerToAgent.instance_uid`:
*"When communication with multiple Agents is multiplexed into one WebSocket connection (for example
when a terminating proxy is used) the `instance_uid` field allows to distinguish which Agent the
ServerToAgent message is addressed to."* Over plain HTTP the same pooling follows from each request
carrying its own `instance_uid`. Any end that keys Agent state on the connection misroutes messages
as soon as a gateway sits in front of it, and that assumption is the expensive one to remove later.

**A Gateway terminates.** The Gateway terminates the downstream handshake and presents its own
certificate upstream, so the Server never sees a downstream certificate and cannot refuse it. A
certificate the Server has revoked would stay a member behind a Gateway until it expires unless the
Gateway refuses it. The specification puts security before convenience (Strategy, "Security before
convenience"; G-17, "the Server accepts only authenticated Agent identities").

**Behind a Gateway the handshake is the only proof.** No per-Agent proof crosses a terminating
Gateway: the Server sees the Gateway's certificate, and the downstream one stays on the downstream
hop. A fleet-wide credential did not identify an Agent behind a Gateway either, and every host held
it, so its removal takes no identity away. A Gateway's certificate already speaks for any Agent
once an operator marks its host as a Gateway ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 7).

**A Gateway must not invent messages.** The specification forbids resolving a protocol gap by
inventing semantics of this project's own. When something fails on one side of a hop, the tempting
fix is to synthesise a message toward the other, and that is exactly what is not available. Nor is
a connection an identity in either direction: upstream connection state says nothing about whether a
downstream Client is alive.

**A pool that is a fixed cost is a pool nobody keeps small.** The prior art opens ten connections at
startup; ten connections for a gateway in front of three Agents is worse than three.

## Decision

We will ship one Client binary with exactly two independent Client Modes, Supervisor Mode and
Gateway Mode, give every Supervisor a Supervisor Endpoint unconditionally, route by `instance_uid`
alone on both ends, and implement Gateway Mode as a `[gateway]` section serving both transports
downstream over mutual TLS 1.3, admitting each downstream Agent by its client certificate from the
fleet's client CA, refusing every downstream certificate the Server has revoked, and a lazily grown,
sticky upstream pool shared by every Agent it carries that forwards messages unchanged and
synthesises none.

1. **Two modes, freely composable, neither implying the other.** Supervisor Mode (`[[supervisor]]`
   blocks) and Gateway Mode (`[gateway]`) run alone or together in one process. A mode is a
   composition of Ports, not a fork of the core: the supervision domain does not learn which mode
   it is in.

2. **Every Supervisor exposes a Supervisor Endpoint, unconditionally.** It binds `127.0.0.1` on the
   block's `endpoint_port` ([ADR-0015](0015-supervisor-mode-and-its-kinds.md)) before the Managed
   Process starts, so a taken port fails startup. It is WebSocket-only, declares `AcceptsStatus` and
   `AcceptsEffectiveConfig`, and folds what the process reports into the owning Agent, whose
   `instance_uid` stays the Supervisor's. For a Managed Process that speaks no OpAMP nothing ever
   connects, and that is the whole of the handling. The Supervisor Endpoint is not a mode.

3. **Neither end keys state on a connection.** The Server indexes Agents by `instance_uid` only; the
   Client maps Agents onto connections without assuming one-to-one. *n* Agents ride *m* connections
   (*n* ≥ *m* ≥ 1), and the pool size is a deployment choice, not a consequence of the Agent count.

4. **`[gateway]` arms Gateway Mode.**

   | Key | Default | Rule |
   |---|---|---|
   | `listen` | none | Required. A Gateway that binds nothing is a configuration error; loopback is the Supervisor Endpoint's job. A bind failure fails startup. |
   | `upstream_connections` | `10` | The pool's cap, not its size. `0` is refused at load. |
   | `max_carried_agents` | `10000` | The most distinct Agents one downstream connection may carry. Past it a report for a *new* Agent is dropped and logged; Agents already carried keep working. `0` is refused at load. |
   | `[gateway.tls]` | none | Required, with `cert_file`, `key_file` and `client_ca_file` for the downstream hop. A Gateway without it, or without `client_ca_file`, is refused at startup, on a loopback `listen` too. |

   The Client's own `endpoint` must be `ws://` or `wss://` when `[gateway]` is present: a polling
   connection cannot carry the Server's pushes to the Agents behind the Gateway.

5. **The downstream endpoint serves both transports.** A downstream Client picks its transport by
   the scheme of its endpoint ([ADR-0012](0012-transports-tls-and-the-servers-two-planes.md)), so the
   Gateway serves a WebSocket upgrade and a plain-HTTP POST on `/v1/opamp`, with the Baseline's
   message size limit, protobuf media type and gzip rules enforced per hop through the shared
   `opamp::endpoint` helpers ([ADR-0011](0011-workspace-crates-and-configuration.md) clause 7).

6. **axum serves it, as an ordinary dependency of the Client crate behind no Cargo feature.** The
   mode lives in `crates/fleet-agent/src/gateway/` (`mod.rs` the endpoint, `pool.rs` the upstream pool,
   `registry.rs` the downstream routes), beside `supervisor/`. The HTTP engine under axum is linked
   through `reqwest` anyway; axum adds the routing layer. TLS on the downstream hop uses the same
   `axum-server` rustls terminator as the Server.

7. **An Agent is assigned to the least-loaded live connection, and stays there.** Assignment is by
   `instance_uid` and sticky while that connection lives, which keeps an Agent's `sequence_num`
   stream and its `ReportFullState` exchanges on one upstream socket. Any live upstream connection
   carries any downstream Agent: the pool is not divided by downstream peer, because nothing the
   Gateway sends upstream depends on which peer an Agent came through.

8. **The pool grows lazily to its cap, and never beyond.** The first Agent opens the first
   connection; a new one opens only when every live connection already carries an Agent and the cap
   is not reached. Past the cap, Agents share. Existing Agents are not re-balanced when a connection
   is added.

9. **A dropped upstream connection re-homes its Agents and says nothing on their behalf.** An Agent
   whose connection is gone is re-assigned by clause 7 on its next report, which is forwarded over
   the new connection. The Gateway sends no `agent_disconnect` for it. The Server marks those Agents
   disconnected because their owning connection dropped, and their next report corrects that.

10. **A downstream Client that vanishes is reported by its absence, not by a message.** An
    `agent_disconnect` it sends is forwarded like any other message. If it just goes away, its routes
    are released and the Gateway forwards nothing. Such an Agent stays connected in the fleet view
    with a `last_seen_ms` that stops advancing, and reads as stale once its staleness budget runs out
    when it declared `ReportsHeartbeat` ([ADR-0026](0026-the-fleet-record.md)).

11. **The downstream handshake and the Server's revocation list are a downstream Agent's
    admission; the Gateway holds no policy of its own, and its own hop is its own.** Mutual TLS is
    per hop and mandatory downstream: the handshake requires a client certificate that chains to
    `client_ca_file` (`ClientAuth::Required` in `opamp`), so a peer without one never reaches OpAMP;
    `client_ca_file` must be the fleet's client CA, never a bootstrap CA. A peer that passed the
    handshake is admitted unless its certificate is on the list of clause 14; that is the one
    refusal the Gateway makes beyond the handshake, and it is the Server's. The client CA and the
    list are both the Server's, so the Gateway applies the Server's policy and holds none of its
    own ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clauses 7, 13). Upstream the Gateway presents
    the Client's own identity, so every downstream Agent arrives as a member, under the Gateway's
    certificate. The Gateway forwards no `Authorization`: one a downstream peer sends is ignored,
    never refused, and nothing is sent upstream in its place. The downstream hop speaks TLS 1.3
    only. A downstream certificate is never forwarded, and no header is invented for it. There is
    no plaintext Gateway, on the loopback neither, because a Gateway admits Agents.

12. **The Gateway is its own Agent, and only its own.** The Client presents its own Agent upstream
    exactly as any Client does, and never presents itself as an Agent it carries.

13. **Routing is by `instance_uid` alone, in both directions.** Upward a report goes out on its
    Agent's connection. Downward the Gateway looks up, per `instance_uid`, the downstream connection
    or pending plain-HTTP exchange that last carried the Agent; a `ServerToAgent` for an Agent it
    does not carry is dropped with a log line, never broadcast.

14. **The Gateway refuses what the Server revoked, and admits nobody while it cannot know.** The
    Gateway fetches the revoked certificates of the fleet's client CA from its Server ([ADR-0065](0065-certificate-revocation-that-follows-renewal-and-reaches-the-gateways.md)
    clause 12) over its own upstream origin, with its own certificate and no `Authorization`, every
    `REVOCATION_REFRESH` (30 s), conditionally on the list it holds. It keeps the list in memory
    only. A downstream peer whose certificate is on the list is answered `401` after the handshake
    and before anything is forwarded, on both transports; an open downstream WebSocket session
    whose certificate the list newly names is closed with `1008` and the reason `revoked`, as the
    Server closes its own, and a report arriving on a session the list no longer admits is not
    forwarded. The Gateway starts serving once its first fetch has answered or failed, and at most
    `REVOCATION_FIRST_WAIT` (5 s) after it started, so its first peers are not refused for want of
    a list. While it holds no list fetched within `REVOCATION_MAX_AGE` (300 s) — from then until a
    first fetch succeeds, and whenever its Server has not answered for that long — it answers every
    downstream request `503` and closes every downstream session with `1008` and the reason
    `revocation list stale`. The three values are named constants. A Gateway the Server refuses the
    list to holds no list, and admits nobody.

**Out of scope:** re-balancing Agents across a grown pool; consolidating the three places TLS
material is configured on a Client.

## Alternatives considered

- **Separate deployables (a supervisor binary, a gateway binary).** Both shapes share their whole
  OpAMP stack, so this multiplies packaging and release surface to express a startup choice, and it
  forecloses a machine that supervises its own processes and fronts others.
- **A third, independently selectable "local server" mode.** It would let an operator configure
  combinations that cannot work and put a conditional on a path that has no reason to vary.
- **Enable the Supervisor Endpoint only for Collector Supervisors, or per block.** More precise, but
  it buys that with a configuration surface and a branch to avoid an idle loopback listener. The
  `opampsupervisor` brings its local server up unconditionally too.
- **One connection per Agent, or multiplexing only in Gateway Mode.** The first makes Gateway Mode
  impossible and induces the connection-equals-agent assumption on the Server; the second leaves two
  routing models in the code while the Server must support the general one anyway.
- **An admission policy of the Gateway's own.** The specification places authentication policy on
  the Server; a gateway with a policy of its own, such as an allow-list or a CA of its choosing,
  duplicates it and forces every change of it to reach every gateway. The Gateway applies two
  things of the Server's: the client CA the Server issues from and the revocation list.
- **A per-Agent proof that travels end to end through the Gateway.** No proof of that kind exists
  on the Agent plane ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)). A fleet-wide
  credential forwarded in a header proved membership, which the downstream handshake already
  proves, and identified no Agent.
- **Keeping the upstream pool partitioned by downstream peer.** Nothing peer-specific travels
  upstream any more, so a partition buys nothing; it costs connections, and at the cap it refuses
  an Agent while connections of another partition sit there.
- **Forwarding the downstream certificate to the Server, which decides.** It keeps every decision
  on the Server, but the Server would trust a certificate the Gateway asserts in a header of its own
  invention, and a pooled upstream connection carrying many Agents could no longer be judged by one
  certificate, so the pool would have to split per certificate. It also leaves a revoked peer on
  the Gateway's downstream hop until the Server answers.
- **Using the last list for as long as the Server is away.** A Gateway that cannot reach its Server
  forwards nothing anyway, and a list kept indefinitely would admit a certificate revoked while it
  was away the moment the Server returns, until the next fetch. A bound costs nothing a working
  Gateway does.
- **The list pushed in an OpAMP message.** A `CustomMessage` is `[Development]` in the Baseline and
  not implemented here; a field of the connection-settings offer is meant for something else.
  Either ties the list to an Agent's session rather than to the Gateway as a host.
- **A plaintext or server-authenticated-only Gateway hop.** A Gateway admits Agents, and the
  specification admits none without a client certificate in the handshake and none over anything
  but TLS 1.3 beyond the loopback. A loopback exception would still let any local process ride the
  Gateway's upstream connections, and a warning in place of a refusal leaves the insecure
  configuration running.
- **A fixed pool opened at startup.** The prior art's shape; it makes the pool a cost paid before
  any Agent arrives.
- **Round-robin instead of least-connections.** With sticky assignment it distributes arrivals
  rather than load, so a Gateway that loses and regains a connection stays lopsided.
- **Re-balancing Agents when a connection is added.** It trades stickiness for an even spread nobody
  asked for, and moving a stream between sockets mid-flight invites reordering.
- **Synthesising `agent_disconnect` for a vanished downstream Client.** The message would say the
  Agent said goodbye when it did not. Server-side staleness is the honest signal.
- **A WebSocket-only downstream endpoint.** The Baseline lets a Client choose either transport; a
  Gateway that silently excludes polling Clients fails as a Client that connects to nothing.
- **Hand-rolling the plain-HTTP endpoint on `hyper`.** One route sounds small until the Baseline's
  `413`, `415` and gzip rules are counted.
- **Gateway Mode behind a Cargo feature.** The released binary must have it on (goal 15, one binary
  for every shape), so it saves nothing where claimed, and a default-off feature is a branch that
  `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` never compile.
- **A crate of its own, `crates/gateway`.** It needs the configuration, TLS material, identity,
  transports and Agent state of the Client crate, so it would depend back on `client`. A crate is not
  a feature boundary either.
- **A Layer-4 passthrough gateway.** It carries client certificates end to end but cannot read OpAMP,
  so it cannot fold *n* Agents onto *m* connections.
- **Reusing the Server crate for the downstream endpoint.** The Client would depend on the Server,
  and the downstream side forwards rather than processes.

## Consequences

- Positive: one deployable to build, sign, install and update on every platform. A fleet scales
  connections independently of its Agent count, and the Server needs no change to sit behind a
  Gateway.
- Positive: the pool costs what it uses, so the default cap needs no tuning for small deployments and
  still bounds large ones. Every connection serves every Agent, so the cap is never reached with
  connections idle for want of the right peer.
- Positive: binding the Supervisor Endpoint to the Supervisor removes a class of invalid
  configurations instead of validating against it.
- Positive: a peer without a certificate from the Gateway's client CA is turned away in the
  handshake, before it reaches OpAMP or the upstream pool, and an insecure Gateway configuration
  cannot start.
- Positive: a revoked certificate is refused behind a Gateway within one refresh, and the session it
  holds there is ended, as it is on the Server.
- Negative / trade-offs: behind a Gateway the Server judges no proof of a downstream Agent; the
  Gateway's handshake and the list are the whole admission. A compromised Gateway speaks for any
  Agent, which the admission decision already accepts for a marked Gateway ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 7). A
  Gateway whose `client_ca_file` names anything but the fleet's client CA admits what the Server
  never issued, and the Server cannot see that file; the manual and review hold it. An unmarked
  Gateway is refused the list and so admits nobody, which keeps that reliance to the hosts an
  operator marked.
- Negative / trade-offs: every Supervisor binds a loopback port whether or not its Managed Process
  uses it.
- Negative / trade-offs: losing one pooled connection marks every Agent riding it disconnected until
  each reports again: one heartbeat interval with a heartbeat configured, otherwise until the Agent
  has something to say.
- Negative / trade-offs: a downstream Client that vanishes without a goodbye stays connected in the
  fleet view; only staleness tells, and only for an Agent that declared `ReportsHeartbeat`.
- Negative / trade-offs: a revocation reaches a Gateway up to `REVOCATION_REFRESH` late. A Gateway
  whose host the operator has not marked as a Gateway, or whose Server is away for more than
  `REVOCATION_MAX_AGE`, admits nobody.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Gateway forwards no `Authorization`, so behind a Server that still
  demands one its Agents are refused; the Server is upgraded before its Gateways.
- Negative / trade-offs: every Gateway needs a server certificate and a client CA, and every Client
  behind it a certificate chaining to that CA, even on a single host or in a test.
- Negative / trade-offs: the binary carries an HTTP routing layer it uses only in Gateway Mode, and
  Supervisor Mode plus Gateway Mode in one process is a real test surface.
- Follow-ups: re-balancing when the pool grows, if a real fleet is ever lopsided enough; consolidating
  TLS material on the Client if a fourth place appears.
