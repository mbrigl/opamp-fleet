# ADR-0060: The Server offers connection settings in the Baseline's classes under one hash, no credential and a plaintext endpoint only on the loopback, the Client proves over TLS 1.3 only what it can, applies no offered header and acknowledges the whole offer, and a Server's capabilities bind what the Client reports

- **Status:** 🟢 accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-06
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** the `[connection_offer]` section of `server.toml`, the offer composition and capability declaration in `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs`, the Client's offer handling in `crates/fleet-agent/src/connection.rs`, `crates/fleet-agent/src/transport/mod.rs` and `crates/fleet-agent/src/engine.rs`, its persisted `connection-settings.pb`, and every gate on a Server capability in `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/agent.rs`
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-0041](0041-connection-settings-offered-securely-and-server-capabilities.md)

## Context

Supersedes [ADR-0041](0041-connection-settings-offered-securely-and-server-capabilities.md)
because the Agent plane admits by client certificate alone
([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md), which supersedes
[ADR-0039](0039-admission-requires-both-proofs-and-enrolment-is-approved.md)), together with the
change to the [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md) drafted with it. There is no fleet credential
left for the Server to offer or for the Client to send: `[connection_offer]` loses its credential,
and an offered header on the OpAMP connection has nothing on the Server that reads it. The rest of
the decision stands as it was.

The specification puts security before convenience (Strategy "Security before convenience", Q-1
"Secure by default"): an offered endpoint is a connection that leaves the host, so it is TLS 1.3
unless it stays on the loopback. And a Server could move the fleet to any host a public CA
certified, since a Client without its own CA file trusts the public roots (measure H24 of
[`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md)).

An endpoint, a heartbeat interval or a client certificate that could only be changed by editing
every host's configuration file would bring back the fleet-wide chore this project exists to
remove. The Baseline's answer is connection settings management. `ConnectionSettingsOffers` carries
an `OpAMPConnectionSettings` (endpoint, headers *"typically used to set access tokens"*, heartbeat
interval, certificate, `tls`, `proxy`), the three own-telemetry destinations, and
`other_connections`, under one `hash` described as *"Hash of all settings"*.
`ConnectionSettingsStatus` reports the last hash with `APPLYING`/`APPLIED`/`FAILED`, and *"if the
hashes are different the Server MUST include the connection_settings field in the response"*.

The Baseline names *"3 classes of destinations"* — the OpAMP Server, own telemetry, and "other" —
and says *"Depending on which connection settings are offered the sequence of operations is
slightly different."* Its verification MUST sits under `ConnectionSettingsOffers.opamp` and is
justified by its scope: *"The Client MUST verify the offered connection settings by actually
connecting before accepting the setting to ensure it does not lose access to the OpAMP Server"*.
The own-telemetry sequence has no verification step and no reconnect; it asks that the Server send
destinations in its first reply *"unless there is no OTLP backend that can be used"*, whether or not
it has OpAMP settings to offer, and that the Agent set `connection_settings_status` when new
settings are received.

The heartbeat interval belongs to the same message: for an Agent with `ReportsHeartbeat` the Server
MAY set `heartbeat_interval_seconds`, the Agent MUST use it, and a plain-HTTP Client MUST use it as
its polling interval. `ConnectionSettingsStatus`, `ReportsConnectionSettingsStatus` and
`heartbeat_interval_seconds` are Development maturity — the same deliberate risk acceptance taken
for `ReportsHeartbeat`.

Capability negotiation is symmetrical: *"after the Agent learns about the capabilities of the
Server the Agent MUST stop using the capabilities that the Server does not support."* With
`opamp-go` as the behavioural oracle ([ADR-0010](0010-protocol-baseline-and-conformance.md)), a
third-party Server may implement only the required bits, and this Client has to notice. Applied
literally, field by field, the rule deadlocks: a Server that sends an offer without declaring
`OffersConnectionSettings` and receives no acknowledgement re-offers forever. And one plausible gate
— `remote_config_status` behind `OffersRemoteConfig` — would be actively harmful. What needs
deciding is the rule that produces the gates, including when not to gate.

## Decision

We will offer connection settings from `server.toml` as one hash-gated message in the Baseline's
three classes, have the Client verify by connecting only the OpAMP half, apply the rest in place,
persist what it applied and acknowledge the whole message once, and make the Client's use of Server
capabilities a stated rule: optimistic until the Server speaks, outranked by what the Server
actually sends, and pessimistic only where a message would be an error.

1. **The Server's standing offer is `[connection_offer]`, and it carries no credential.** It names
   any of: an optional `heartbeat_interval_secs`, and an optional `endpoint` (e.g. for a Server
   move). The `endpoint` is `wss://` or `https://`; `ws://` or `http://` only when its host is a
   loopback IP literal — `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, never a host name, `localhost` included. An
   `endpoint` that breaks this is refused at startup with a message naming
   `[connection_offer] endpoint`, never warned about, so the Server never offers a fleet a
   plaintext path off the host. An empty section fails at startup. A credential key —
   `bearer_token_file`, `username`, `password_file`, or the inline `bearer_token` or `password` — is
   refused at startup with a message naming the key: the Agent plane admits by client certificate
   alone ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)), so an offered credential
   would be one nothing reads. The OpAMP settings the Server offers carry no `headers`.

2. **One message, one SHA-256 hash, offered on mismatch.** The Server composes the OpAMP settings
   and the own-telemetry destinations into one `ConnectionSettingsOffers`, hashes the whole message,
   and includes it whenever an Agent's reported `last_connection_settings_hash` differs. The OpAMP
   half goes only to Agents declaring `AcceptsOpAMPConnectionSettings`; each telemetry destination
   only to an Agent declaring the matching signal ([ADR-0025](0025-own-telemetry.md)). With only
   telemetry to offer, that is the whole offer, with no `opamp` block. A certificate issued in
   answer to a CSR ([ADR-0017](0017-admission-and-authentication.md) clause 9) travels as the
   standing OpAMP settings plus that certificate, under a hash of its own.

3. **The Server declares `OffersConnectionSettings` whenever it can offer anything** — a
   `[connection_offer]`, a `[telemetry_offer]`, or a `[client_ca]` whose issued certificate travels
   as an offer. An undeclared capability is never exercised, a declared one never hollow.

4. **An offer is actionable when it carries anything this Client can put in force** — OpAMP
   settings, or any of `own_metrics`, `own_traces`, `own_logs`. An offer carrying only
   `other_connections` is not actionable while `AcceptsOtherConnectionSettings` is undeclared:
   acknowledging what cannot be applied is a false report, and a conforming Server does not send
   it. When `other_connections` is implemented it joins the telemetry class of clause 6 — no
   verification by connecting, no reconnect, one acknowledgement.

5. **The OpAMP half is verified by actually connecting, then persisted, then reconnected with.** On
   receipt the Client reports `APPLYING`, then checks the candidate's endpoint by clause 1's rule:
   a `ws://` or `http://` endpoint whose host is not a loopback IP literal is refused without
   connecting, and the offer is reported `FAILED` with an `error_message` naming the endpoint and
   the reason. A candidate that moves to another `wss://` or `https://` endpoint is refused the
   same way unless `[tls] ca_file` is set, and is then verified against that CA alone: under the
   public roots, a Server could move the fleet to any host a public CA ever certified, and the
   move would outlive the operator's file (clause 9). Otherwise it connects with the candidate —
   offered fields, falling back to those in force, an offered certificate included, offered
   `headers` never (clause 8) — over TLS 1.3, presenting the client certificate in force unless the
   offer carries one, and sending no `Authorization`; only a candidate on the loopback connects in
   plaintext. A WebSocket candidate must complete its handshake, a plain-HTTP candidate a real
   exchange. Only then are the settings persisted, an issued certificate stored, and the connection
   dropped so the runtime reconnects with them, possibly on the other transport. A refused or
   failed verification keeps everything in force as it was and reports `FAILED` with the error.

6. **A telemetry destination is not verified by connecting, and does not restart the connection.**
   Reachability of an OTLP receiver is not this Client's to establish at offer time; a receiver
   that is down is not an offer that is wrong. What is checked before it is put in force is what
   the Client can decide alone — the cleartext rule and the unhonoured fields of
   [ADR-0025](0025-own-telemetry.md) — and a refusal is reported, not swallowed. A telemetry-only
   offer is applied in place; its acknowledgement rides the reports already owed, and the transport
   loop carries on. The headers of a telemetry destination are an OTLP receiver's, not admission:
   they stay as [ADR-0048](0048-own-telemetry-over-tls-1-3-and-plaintext-only-to-the-loopback.md) has them, still offered only on member
   connections ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)), and clause 8 does not
   reach them.

7. **One offer, one acknowledgement.** A single `connection_settings_status` answers each offer,
   and its `error_message` names everything dropped or refused across both halves. If the OpAMP
   half fails verification, nothing from that offer is persisted or applied, the telemetry half
   included, and the offer is reported `FAILED`. Half-applying an offer whose other half was
   rejected would leave the Server unable to tell what is running.

8. **`tls`, `proxy` and `headers` are not honoured, and the acknowledgement says so.** An offer is
   applied for every field the Client honours — endpoint, heartbeat, certificate — and then
   reported `FAILED` with an `error_message` naming the dropped fields, offered `headers` by their
   keys and never their values. The hash is echoed either way, so the Server does not re-offer in
   a loop. `TLSConnectionSettings` is refused on merit: a Server able to command
   `insecure_skip_verify` could switch off the check that proves it is the Server, and trust is an
   operator's file ([ADR-0012](0012-transports-tls-and-the-servers-two-planes.md) clause 5).
   `ProxyConnectionSettings` has nothing on this Client to configure. Both are Development
   upstream. Offered `headers` on the OpAMP connection are refused on merit too: the Agent plane
   reads no `Authorization` and admits by client certificate alone
   ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)), so an applied header would be a
   value the Server plants on every connection of the fleet, persisted and sent upstream with no
   reader on this Server, and carried to whatever endpoint a later offer moves the fleet to.
   [`CONFORMANCE.md`](../CONFORMANCE.md) records the three refusals.

9. **What is in force is persisted as `connection-settings.pb`, and it outranks `supervisor.toml`.**
   The file in `state_dir` is the Baseline's own `ConnectionSettingsOffers`: the merged settings in
   force plus the hash that reports them `APPLIED`, written owner-only. OpAMP fields fold — an offer
   that omits a field leaves the one in force — and the file carries an `opamp` block only when an
   offer or the state it folds into had one. How the telemetry destinations fold is
   [ADR-0025](0025-own-telemetry.md)'s. At startup the persisted settings override
   `supervisor.toml`'s `endpoint` and heartbeat and poll intervals, and the persisted hash restores
   the status to report. The persisted OpAMP settings carry no `headers`: an `Authorization` header
   that a file holds from an earlier rotation is dropped on load and never sent. `supervisor.toml`
   stays what the operator wrote; deleting the file reverts to it.

10. **An offered heartbeat replaces the configured interval.** A non-zero
    `heartbeat_interval_seconds` becomes the heartbeat period on WebSocket and the polling interval
    on plain HTTP. The Server judges staleness by the heartbeat it offered
    ([ADR-0026](0026-the-fleet-record.md)).

11. **Settings are connection-scoped; offers are per Agent.** Over one connection carrying n Agents
    ([ADR-0009](0009-client-modes-and-the-gateway.md)), the Server offers to each, and the Client
    keeps one pending offer, verifies and switches once per hash, and reports status for every
    Agent it carries.

12. **The Client is optimistic until the Server has spoken, and bound once it has.** Until a
    `ServerToAgent` with a non-zero `capabilities` field has been seen, every report rides; from then
    on the Server's declaration governs. A later `capabilities` of zero is the Baseline's "MAY be
    omitted", not a retraction, so the last non-zero declaration stands.

13. **A received offer outranks the bitmask for the report that answers it.** A received
    `connection_settings` latches the connection-settings status on for the life of the Agent,
    whatever `OffersConnectionSettings` says and even when the offer was one this Client could not
    act on. The alternative is a Server that offers and never learns, and therefore never stops.

14. **Reports are gated where the Server's bit governs the report itself.** Effective configuration
    is withheld from a Server that declared capabilities without `AcceptsEffectiveConfig`,
    `package_statuses` from one without `AcceptsPackagesStatus`, and `connection_settings_status`
    from one without `OffersConnectionSettings`, subject to clause 13. A withheld report is not
    queued: the dirty flag clears as usual, and the state returns in the full snapshot after any
    reconnect or `ReportFullState`, so a late-declared bit never receives a stale status.

15. **Sending is gated pessimistically only where the message would be an error.** A CSR is
    withheld until the Server has declared `AcceptsConnectionSettingsRequest`, because a Server that
    does not sign answers it `BadRequest`. This is the one exception to clause 12, and its test is
    narrow: the message would be rejected, not merely unused.

16. **`remote_config_status` is never gated.** `OffersRemoteConfig` says what the Server sends; what
    licenses an inbound status is `AcceptsStatus`, which every Server MUST set, and there is no
    `AcceptsRemoteConfigStatus`. The hash is the only input to the Server's re-offer decision, so
    gating it would put the fleet in a re-offer loop the moment a Server stopped declaring the bit;
    and against a Server that never offers a configuration the status is already absent, so the
    gate would do nothing where it was meant to help. The reasons are recorded here, at the code,
    and in [`CONFORMANCE.md`](../CONFORMANCE.md).

17. **An undeclared capability is not exercised on the Client's end either.** A new capability is
    gated under clause 14 or 15; a decision not to gate one is recorded in `CONFORMANCE.md` with its
    reason, as clause 16 is.

**Out of scope:** how the Agent plane admits and how it treats a Client of an older version that
still sends `Authorization` ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)); the
audit entries an offer leaves; `AcceptsOtherConnectionSettings`; what own telemetry is and how its
destinations and their headers fold ([ADR-0025](0025-own-telemetry.md));
`connection_settings_status` in the fleet view and the REST API; an audit of the Server's own use
of Agent capabilities under the same rule.

## Alternatives considered

- **Keeping an optional offered credential** — the Agent plane reads none
  ([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)); an offered credential would be a
  secret the Server keeps, sends and the fleet persists, for no check anywhere.
- **Honouring offered `headers` other than `Authorization`** — no header has a reader on this
  Server, and a generic pass-through would let a Server, or whoever can make one send an offer,
  attach any value to every upstream connection of the fleet and keep it there across restarts.
- **Dropping offered `headers` silently and reporting `APPLIED`** — a false report;
  `CONFORMANCE.md` records gaps, not false reports, and a Server rotating a token through headers
  would believe it in force.
- **Refusing an offer wholesale when it carries `headers`** — an older Server that still offers a
  credential would freeze the endpoint, heartbeat and certificate the same offer carries.
- **Accepting any scheme the Server offers** — the Client would follow a Server, or whoever can
  make one send an offer, onto a plaintext endpoint off the host and hand it the fleet's reports in
  the clear; Q-1 forbids that whatever the configuration, so both ends refuse it.
- **Offering blind, without `ReportsConnectionSettingsStatus`** — the Server could never stop
  re-offering, and rejection would be invisible.
- **Hot reload instead of a Server restart to change the standing offer** — a feature this Server
  does not have; a restart is how `server.toml` changes take effect.
- **Every offer always carries an `opamp` block** — the Server would synthesise a block it has
  nothing to put in, every telemetry change would verify-and-reconnect the whole fleet, and it
  contradicts the Baseline's three classes and its first-reply SHOULD.
- **Requiring `[connection_offer]` beside `[telemetry_offer]` and documenting the gap** — an
  operator would have to configure an endpoint or heartbeat offer to get metrics, a coupling with
  no reason.
- **A hash and an acknowledgement per class** — the Baseline defines one hash over all settings and
  one status field; splitting them would invent protocol semantics.
- **Verifying a telemetry destination by connecting, for symmetry** — a momentarily down receiver
  would turn a correct offer `FAILED` and the Server would re-offer settings that were never wrong.
- **Refusing an offer wholesale when it carries `tls` or `proxy`** — an unsupported extra would
  freeze the endpoint move and certificate the same offer carries.
- **Honouring `TLSConnectionSettings`** — most of what it can say weakens verification.
- **Keeping `APPLIED` for a partly honoured offer and documenting it** — `CONFORMANCE.md` records
  gaps, not false reports; a declared capability is a promise a peer relies on.
- **Gating every report on its corresponding bit, no exceptions** — deadlocks the acknowledgement
  against Servers that offer without declaring, and breaks `remote_config_status`.
- **Gating nothing, relying on the Server to ignore what it does not want** — defensible on the wire,
  but the Baseline states a MUST and third-party Servers are a target.
- **A mechanical bit-to-field table** — the mapping is not one-to-one in either direction, so the
  table would carry exceptions; revisit if the gated fields multiply.

## Sources / Prior art

- [OpAMP specification — Connection Settings Management](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-spec/blob/main/specification.md#connection-settings-management)
  (Baseline `v0.20.0`) — the three classes and per-class sequences, the verification MUST under
  `ConnectionSettingsOffers.opamp`, the own-telemetry sequence and its first-reply SHOULD, the hash
  gate MUST, the heartbeat obligations, and `OpAMPConnectionSettings.headers` as the field
  *"typically used to set access tokens"*; *Interoperability of Partial Implementations* for the
  symmetrical capability MUST; `ServerToAgent.capabilities` (*"MAY be omitted in subsequent
  ServerToAgent messages"*); and the `ServerCapabilities` comments distinguishing
  `OffersRemoteConfig` from `AcceptsStatus`.
- [`opamp-go` client callbacks](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-go/client/types)
  — `OnOpampConnectionSettings` hands the offer to the Agent, which accepts after its own
  verification; the library then reconnects.
- [OpAMP Supervisor specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/cmd/opampsupervisor/specification/README.md)
  — persists Server-offered connection settings across restarts.
- [`opampextension`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/extension/opampextension)
  — declares a small subset of capabilities and none of the connection-settings ones, the reason a
  peer's declaration cannot be assumed generous and why this behaviour was read from the
  specification rather than checked against it.

## Consequences

- Positive: the Server can retune every Agent's heartbeat and polling cadence and move the fleet to
  a new endpoint without touching a host, and an issued client certificate reaches its Agent the
  same way. No secret sits in `[connection_offer]`, in a file beside it, or in a Client's state
  directory.
- Positive: a Server with only `[telemetry_offer]` reaches its Agents, and a telemetry endpoint
  move never disconnects the fleet.
- Positive: a conforming but terse Server is safe to talk to; the next capability has a stated
  rule and worked examples of each branch.
- Negative / trade-offs: two lifecycles where "every offer is proved by connecting" would be one;
  the seam is the Baseline's own and is named in one predicate.
- Negative / trade-offs: a refused telemetry destination fails an offer whose OpAMP half applied
  fine; the `error_message` says what was dropped, but a Server reading only the enum sees a
  failure. Accepted as the price of one hash.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Server that offers a credential in `headers` — one of an older version,
  or a third-party Server — receives `FAILED` for every such offer, though the endpoint, heartbeat
  and certificate it carried are in force. The `error_message` names the headers, and the echoed
  hash stops the re-offer.
- Negative / trade-offs: the persisted settings are a state file an operator must know about;
  several surfaces are Development maturity upstream.
- Negative / trade-offs: clause 13 means a Server that sent one offer receives connection-settings
  status for that Agent's life; a withheld report is lost until the next full snapshot; clause 16
  is a documented departure from a literal field-by-field reading that every review has to be
  argued out of.
- Follow-ups: `connection_settings_status` in the fleet view and the REST API, so a stalled endpoint
  move is visible; the Server's use of Agent capabilities under the same rule.
