# ADR-0037: A Package is one release of an Agent type at a version, a Deployment that signs it is the only thing rolled out, a host or a Gateway fetches only what its Agents are offered, and a Supervisor installs only a signed package from an allowed source and rolls back only to a predecessor

- **Status:** 🟡 proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-10
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** `crates/fleet-server/src/packages.rs`, `crates/fleet-server/src/deployments.rs`, the package, deployment and download routes of `crates/fleet-server/src/api.rs` with the download handler `download_package`, `packages_dir` and the package limits in `crates/fleet-server/src/config.rs`, the package assignment in `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs` and `crates/fleet-server/src/agent_store.rs`, what a host speaks for in `crates/fleet-server/src/revocation.rs` and `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs`, the `download.refused` audit entry, the startup notice of `crates/fleet-server/src/main.rs` when `[client_ca]` is absent, the platform table in `crates/opamp/src/attributes.rs`, the `host.arch` the Client reports, the Packages and Deployments tabs of the bundled UI, `docs/SPECIFICATION.md` and its Non-Goal "Authorization and multi-tenancy", the Gateway's package cache and its download route in `crates/fleet-agent/src/gateway/` (`cache.rs`, the route in `mod.rs`, the offers `registry.rs` records), the cache directory under the Client's `state_dir`, `crates/fleet-agent/src/packages.rs` and the Client's waiting on `Retry-After` there, `crates/fleet-agent/src/archive.rs`, `crates/fleet-agent/src/install.rs`, `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/process.rs`, the package handling in `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/agent.rs`, the `[packages]` and `[updates]` sections, the `[gateway] package_cache_bytes` key and the `program_path` and `retain_previous_secs` keys of `supervisor.toml` and their parsing in `crates/fleet-agent/src/config.rs`, `crates/fleet-core/src/package.rs`, and the `package sign` command of `opamp-fleetctl`

## Context

The [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md) puts security before convenience (Strategy *Security
before convenience*, Quality Goal **Q-1** *Secure by default*) and says that no vulnerability can
be ruled out: no package and no credential leaves a host unencrypted beyond the loopback; software
is installed only when it is signed with a key the operator holds and fetched from a source the
operator allowed; an Agent installs no package without a valid signature, so an unsigned fleet is
not a policy the Server supports.

Goal 10 asks the Server to update an Agent's binary — the Collector's and the Client's own: it
verifies each Package before it is applied, reports the outcome, and rolls back on failure; a
failed update is reported, not silent. The Baseline's mechanism is a hash-gated sync. The Agent
reports `PackageStatuses.server_provided_all_packages_hash`; on a mismatch the Server sends
`PackagesAvailable` — per package a type, a version, a per-package `hash` and a
`DownloadableFile{download_url, content_hash, signature, headers}` — and the Agent downloads,
verifies, installs and reports each package through `Downloading → Installing → Installed |
InstallFailed`. The path runs from what the Server holds and how an artifact gets there, through
how an operator aims, signs and releases it and who may fetch it, to the Agent that downloads,
verifies, unpacks, swaps, health-gates and rolls it back. When content reaches an Agent and the
version test it must pass are [ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md)'s.

The store, and which of the held artifacts can be meant for a given Agent at all:

- **A release is one version across several artifacts.** The release pipeline
  ([ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md)) publishes five platform builds
  of one version, and upstream projects publish more. The store needs an object that *is* that
  release, or "which version is this at" has one answer per platform and a half-finished upload
  looks like a rollout in progress.
- **A mismatched binary is the worst mistake available.** A Windows artifact swapped over a Linux
  host's program, or a Promtail build swapped over a Collector, is caught only by the health gate —
  a fleet-wide outage window for a mistake the Server had every attribute in hand to refuse. A
  filter that holds only when an operator remembers to write it is not a guarantee.
- **Three spellings of one platform meet here.** Rust says `x86_64`/`aarch64`/`macos`; the semantic
  conventions — which the Baseline names as the vocabulary of `AgentDescription` — and the
  Collector's `opampextension` say `amd64`/`arm64`/`darwin`. A Managed Process's attributes are
  folded over the Supervisor's, so with two spellings a host would report a different architecture
  depending on what runs on it, and a filter written against one spelling would stop matching.
- **Upstream publishes archives, at an address, with a checksum.** `opentelemetry-collector-releases`
  publishes `.tar.gz`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.msi` — never a bare binary — and a `checksums.txt` with a
  SHA-256 per asset. Downloading 400 MiB to upload it again moves the same bytes twice. The
  Baseline's Download Server *"may be on the same host as the OpAMP Server or a different host"*,
  and `DownloadableFile.headers` exists so an Agent can authenticate to one.
- **The download is not secret.** Agents fetch artifacts without an operator credential, so what
  protects an installed binary is verification — the content hash, and a signature where the Agent
  holds a key — not transport secrecy. An artifact whose confidentiality matters must therefore be
  unreadable to the Server too. What travels with a download is another matter: a referenced
  entry's headers may carry a bearer token, and a plaintext request hands it to every network
  between the Agent and the source.
- **The Agent type is a fact the Server can read.** Every Agent this Client presents reports its
  type as `service.name` ([ADR-0015](0015-what-an-agent-reports-about-itself.md)), which the
  Baseline defines as "a reverse FQDN that uniquely identifies the Agent type".

What identifies a Package — its name on the wire, its hash, its layout and routes — and how a
Package is aimed, signed and released: [ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md)
clause 9 requires an aim, its resource-level act (ADR-0036 clause 5) needs an object to name, and
ADR-0036 clause 19 asks for counts. Four observations shape it:

- **A name beside the Agent type is a second identity for one thing.** The type decides fit; a
  free-form name would decide nothing but would group, and the only thing it could add — two
  artifacts of one type under different names — is an ambiguity that resolution would have to rank
  its way out of. In every artifact this project ships the two are the same string already
  (`supervisor`).
- **The Baseline's addon kind has no Client behind it.** The Client refuses every addon offer, as a
  defence against a foreign Server writing one over a Managed Process's binary; a Server-side kind
  flag would never change what a host installs.
- **Aim on the artifact makes "what is this" and "who gets it" one record**, and where several aims
  match one Agent, "which artifact does this host get" becomes a computation across all of them —
  a specificity ranking with ties to refuse — which no operator can read off any one object.
- **A Selector cannot say "not".** Every Selector is equality over the effective description
  ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md)); "everyone except the canary hosts" is not
  writable. Disjoint targets must come from membership — which is what Server-set labels
  ([ADR-0026](0026-the-fleet-record.md)) and provisioned attributes already are.

What an operator signs off on is a release to a set of machines, not a pile of bytes; and a rollout
should name "what this channel runs", not *n* artifacts nothing holds together. The package store
and the Agent records are read only in the shapes this Server writes.

The download route serves an uploaded artifact's bytes on the Agent plane
(clause 13,
clause 20). It sits behind the
same TLS handshake as `/v1/opamp`
([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)
clause 8) and requires a certificate from the client CA
([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 23). Admission decides fleet
membership. None of these says which member may fetch which artifact. Today
`download_package` serves any artifact in the store to any member that names it: type, version and
Platform are all in the path and the query, and both are easy to guess.

Membership is fleet-wide, but releases are not. A rollout releases a pinned Package to one Agent
at a time ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clauses 2, 3, 5), and a
Deployment aims at a partition of the fleet by a host property such as `channel`, `region` or
`tenant` (clause 25). With
the route open, a host in one partition can fetch another partition's builds. It can fetch a
version the operator has saved but not yet released, such as the next canary build or a build
licensed to one tenant. A compromised host can also map the whole store by trying versions. An
artifact encrypted with an `archive_key` stays unreadable
(clause 6), but most
artifacts are not encrypted. The host that leaks least
when it is compromised is the one that was never given more than its own Agents receive.

A Client behind a Gateway must receive uploaded artifacts, and the maintainer decided that the
Gateway delivers them from a cache of its own rather than by relaying each request. Downloads
behind a Gateway do not reach the Server. A Gateway that hands an artifact to a downstream host
answers the question of who receives which uploaded artifact one hop further down, so its rule
belongs in the decision that answers it at the Server. A marked Gateway's certificate fetches what
is offered to any Agent (clause 37), and that breadth is what the cache fetches with. Clauses 42 to
48 bound what the Gateway passes on to the hosts behind it, so that a downstream host receives from
the Gateway no more than the Server would serve it directly.

Forces on the download route and the Gateway:

- **The host is the one bound the Server has.** A certificate proves fleet membership and the
  host it was issued to, not an Agent. An `instance_uid` belongs to the host whose certificate
  first reported it. A host marked as a Gateway speaks for any Agent
  ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 7). Admission is a fleet-wide
  trust boundary, and within it the host is the only bound between Agents ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 14). Any test of
  "may fetch" can be no finer than the host.
- **What reaches an Agent is already decided, per Agent.** Its package offer is composed from its
  assignment alone. The offer is the assigned Package's entry for the Platform the Agent reports,
  signed by the Deployment that released it
  ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 3,
  clause 28). Type fit is a
  mandatory precondition of every offer
  (clause 9). The download
  needs no rule of its own. It needs the same test the offer uses.
- **The code has a gap against that clause.** `offer_for_assigned` (through `assigned_entry`)
  tests the Platform but not the Agent type. Type fit is checked when the operator rolls out, and
  is not checked again when the offer is composed. An Agent that reports a different `service.name`
  after the rollout is still offered the old type's Package.
- **Configurations already reach only their own Agent.** A composed config map travels in the
  `ServerToAgent` addressed to one `instance_uid`. It is composed from what was released to that
  Agent ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clauses 6, 7,
  [ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 3). It answers only reports the host
  may make for that `instance_uid`. No route on the Agent plane serves configurations.
- **Without a cache in the Gateway, downloads behind it do not reach the Server.** A Client resolves a path
  `download_url` against its own OpAMP endpoint (`resolve_url` in
  `crates/fleet-agent/src/packages.rs`). Behind a Gateway that endpoint is the Gateway, which
  serves only `/v1/opamp` (`opamp::server::router` without `any_path`). The `GET` is answered `404`
  there. With `advertised_url` set, the offered URL is absolute and names the Server. That URL is
  not the Client's own origin, so `Sources::permit` refuses it unless it is listed in `[packages]
  allowed_sources`. If it is listed, the Client fetches it with its anonymous client, which
  presents no certificate, and the Server's handshake refuses it
  ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 23). A Client behind a
  Gateway that serves no download route therefore receives only referenced artifacts, and the only
  downloads a Gateway's certificate makes are those of the Gateway host's own Agents.
- **A partition is only as strong as the hosts it partitions.** A Selector matches the effective
  description, which is what the Agent reports plus the Server's labels
  (clauses 22, 25). It cannot
  tell the two sources apart, and where they collide, what the Agent reports wins
  (`labels::effective_description`). A compromised host can therefore report another partition's
  key and value, such as the Client's own `[attributes]` table would, under a fresh
  `instance_uid`. That Agent waits in the fleet view
  ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 6). The next bulk rollout of that
  partition's Deployment assigns it, and the host can then fetch what was released to it. This
  holds for a partition set by a Server label as well, because a reported attribute with the
  label's key satisfies the same Selector. What this decision bounds is fetching what was released
  to Agents the host does not speak for. It does not bound an Agent the host itself places in a
  partition.
- **Hiding is cheap only if it is complete.** An answer that differs between "exists, not yours"
  and "does not exist" lets a host list the store. HTTP allows a server to hide a forbidden resource
  behind `404` (RFC 9110 §15.5.4).
- **Behind a Gateway, one artifact crosses one link once per Agent.** A Gateway stands at a
  network boundary in front of a site or a segment (specification, Gateway Mode; G-15). A rollout
  that releases one Package to the n Agents behind it sends the same bytes n times over the link
  the Gateway was placed to spare, and asks the Server's store and its fleet lock n times.
- **Relaying each request costs what the cache saves.** A Gateway that relays the route fetches
  with its own certificate, because it terminates the downstream handshake and presents its own
  upstream ([ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)
  clause 11); no downstream certificate ever reaches the Server. Every relayed request costs one
  token of the Gateway's aggregate bucket (clause 40,
  [ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md) clause 22), so a rollout to more
  Agents than that bucket's burst throttles itself by its own size, and every byte still crosses
  the link once per Agent.
- **The Gateway already sees every offer it carries.** Each `ServerToAgent` for an Agent behind it
  passes through its registry on the way down (ADR-0014 clause 13), with the offer's
  `download_url` and `content_hash`. The registry knows which downstream connection carries the
  Agent, and so the certificate that connection presented. The Gateway forwards the message
  unchanged; reading it changes nothing on the wire.
- **The Gateway's certificate is as broad as its mark makes it.** Under clause 37 it may fetch what
  is offered to any Agent. A cache gives it no artifact it could not fetch already. What a cache
  must not do is widen what a downstream host receives: a Gateway that served whatever it holds to
  any admitted peer would reopen, behind the Gateway, the enumeration and the cross-partition fetch
  that clause 37 closes at the Server.
- **A downstream host is named the way the Server names it.** A host behind a Gateway enrols with
  the Server directly or is provisioned by an operator
  ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 25). A certificate the Server
  issued carries `urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>`, and an operator who provisions by hand names the host
  with that SAN URI (clause 37). The Gateway reads it from its own handshake. The host register is
  the Server's, and the Gateway does not hold it.
- **Verification stays with the installing Client.** The Client checks the content hash and the
  signature over type, version and hash before it installs, whatever host served the bytes
  (clauses 53, 54). A cache on the
  path changes where the bytes come from, not what is installed. Checking the hash at the Gateway
  as well keeps it from storing or passing on bytes the offer does not name, and a corrupted fetch
  is noticed once there instead of by every Agent behind it.

On the Agent, a signature over the artifact's bytes alone says nothing about what the artifact is
for. Any artifact signed with the operator's key installed as any Supervisor's program, at any
version label, older ones included; a compromised Server could roll a Managed Process back to a
signed build with a known flaw, or hand a Collector a Telegraf binary. Measure H23 of
[`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md) asked for the signature to cover the Agent type and the version,
as a Deployment already pairs them (clause 28), and for a Client-side refusal of a downgrade. The
forces on the Agent:

- **A running process cannot reliably replace its own binary**, so the work crosses a process
  boundary (the specification's *Updater*). For a Managed Process that boundary already exists:
  the Supervisor owns its process's stop, spawn and apply-grace health gate
  ([ADR-0032](0032-supervisor-mode-kinds-directories-and-what-the-server-may-change.md)). The Client's own binary is the other case
  ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)).
- **Verification protects the host; the source set bounds what is exposed.** An artifact URL may
  point at the Server's download route or at a mirror or release page, so what stands between the
  bytes and an executed program is the content hash and an Ed25519 signature made with a key the
  operator holds (the Baseline's *Code Signing* section leaves the method to the Agent). The
  `ring` provider the build already carries
  ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)) verifies Ed25519. A hash alone
  proves only that the bytes are the ones the offer named, and whoever can make the offer names
  the hash too. The transport still decides what a download exposes: the offer's `headers` are an
  operator's token, the Client's certificate is its fleet identity, and an unbounded set of
  sources is an unbounded set of hosts both could be presented to
  ([`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md) H12, H13, H19).
- **An upstream release is an archive.** `opentelemetry-collector-releases` publishes `.tar.gz`,
  `.deb`, `.rpm` and `.msi`, never a bare binary, with a `checksums.txt` of SHA-256 values and
  sigstore keyless signatures. The GLPI Agent's portable Windows build is a `.zip`
  ([ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md)). An in-house agent may have to stay confidential
  wherever it is stored. The protocol carries one file per package and leaves multi-file packages
  to "any file format that allows storing multiple files in a single file".
- **Many agents are more than one file.** Fluent Bit ships an executable plus the shared objects
  and plugins it loads, and a static build is not available upstream. A package that unpacks into
  a tree gives the archive a say in where bytes land — a security boundary this decision creates.
- **The rollback lifecycle must end.** Discarding a first install that will not start empties the
  program directory and the Server re-offers it: a download loop. A predecessor that also fails to
  start must not be respawned forever. And "survived the grace" is a first signal, not a final one,
  so the predecessor is worth keeping for a while.

## Decision

We will hold software in a store of packages — each one release of one Agent type at one version,
holding one uploaded or referenced artifact per Platform — never open, pack or fetch an artifact
on the Server, spell a Platform the semantic conventions' way everywhere, and make type and
platform fit a mandatory precondition of every offer; identify a **Package** by its Agent type and
version alone, holding nothing but its entries, and introduce the **Deployment** — a named channel
aimed by a non-empty Selector, holding one Package per Agent type and the signature of each
artifact — as the only thing that is rolled out, with an Agent belonging to at most one; serve an
uploaded artifact on the download route only to a member certificate whose host speaks for an
Agent to which that artifact, identified by Agent type, version and Platform, is currently
offered, have a Gateway fetch each uploaded artifact it relays an offer of once with its own
certificate and pass it on only to a downstream host whose Agent it relayed that offer to, and
answer every other request for an artifact, on the Server and on a Gateway, exactly as we answer
one for an artifact that does not exist; and have each Supervisor take one top-level package
offered for its Agent only when the operator's Ed25519 verification key is configured, stream it
over TLS 1.3 from an allowed source to its own directory, verify its SHA-256 and its Ed25519
signature before anything is unpacked, open it on the host whether it is a bare program or a
`.tar.gz`, `.7z` or `.zip` holding one file or a whole tree, swap it in by rename, health-gate it
on the apply grace, roll back only to a real predecessor, stop restarting after three failed
starts, and keep the superseded version for a configurable window.

### The package store

1. **The store lives under `packages_dir` and is the Server's only source of software.**
   `packages_dir` (default `fleet-packages`) holds every package; it is managed through the REST
   API and restored at startup. `OffersPackages` and `AcceptsPackagesStatus` are declared only while
   the store holds a package — an undeclared capability is never exercised. The directory is
   created owner-only (`0700`) and every metadata file is written `0600` through a temporary file
   and a rename, because a referenced entry's headers may carry a bearer token (clause 5).

2. **A package is one release: one Agent type, one version, fixed at creation.** Both are stated
   when the package is created and never edited; a new version is a **new package**, never a change
   to an old one. There is no untyped package and no moment in which one exists. The store keeps
   every version openly as its own package until an operator deletes it — there is no hidden
   "previous" artifact and no automatic pruning, and the store is not where rollback happens
   ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 18). The type is compared
   **raw** (clause 9); the version orders as [ADR-0011](0011-versions-resolved-in-the-internal-crate.md) clause 9 orders versions.

3. **A package holds one entry per Platform, so a duplicate is unrepresentable.** Entries are a map
   keyed by the canonical `(os, arch)` pair. Writing an entry for a Platform the package already
   holds replaces it; deleting the last one leaves an empty package, kept, because a package being
   assembled is a normal state and deleting the package is its own act. One entry suffices; five
   platforms are five entries under one identity. When an entry may be written at all is
   [ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 8's rule.

4. **An entry is an uploaded artifact or a reference to one.**
   - **Uploaded:** the body of an entry upload is the artifact. The Server streams it to a staging
     file in the package's own directory (named per Platform, so parallel uploads of one release do
     not collide), hashes it while streaming, refuses an empty one, and renames it into place as
     `<os>-<arch>.bin`. One artifact may be at most `max_package_size_bytes` (default 1 GiB, `413`
     beyond), the whole store at most `max_total_package_bytes` (default 16 GiB, `507` when the
     upload would pass it — checked before streaming and again after); `0` for either is refused at
     load.
   - **Referenced:** the entry is a `url`, a **mandatory** `sha256` (64 hex characters, as a
     release's `checksums.txt` publishes it) and optional `headers`. The `url` is `https://`;
     `http://` is accepted only when its host is a loopback IP literal, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]` — a
     host name never counts as loopback, `localhost` included. The Server refuses any other `url`
     when the entry is set through the REST API (`400`, naming the rule), so neither the artifact
     nor the headers an Agent sends for it cross a network in plaintext. The Server stores only
     that reference and offers it verbatim as the `DownloadableFile`; it never
     downloads the artifact and has nothing to serve. A referenced entry replacing an uploaded one
     deletes the bytes it replaces. The headers are stored in cleartext (owner-only) and travel to
     every Agent offered the entry.

   The checksum is supplied, never derived: for a reference nothing central ever sees the bytes, so
   the operator's `sha256` is the one thing standing between a URL and a host, and every Agent
   checks it.

5. **Setting a source probes it once, as a typo catch and nothing more.** The Server sends one
   `HEAD` over TLS 1.3 with the given headers, a 10-second timeout and no redirect following, so
   it never follows a source onto a plaintext `url`. A `4xx` answer
   refuses the write (`400`, with a hint about headers on `401`/`403`); a source the Server cannot
   reach is stored anyway, because the Server is not in the download path. The probe refuses to aim
   at a non-routable address — link-local (the cloud metadata address among it), the shared/CGNAT
   range, unspecified, broadcast, documentation and `0.0.0.0/8` — and deliberately not at loopback
   or the RFC 1918 / unique-local ranges, where an operator's mirror legitimately lives, over
   `https://` as clause 4 requires. The probe
   proves nothing about what an Agent will later receive; only the `sha256` does.

6. **The Server never creates, packs, repacks, encrypts, decrypts or opens an artifact.** What it
   is given is finished — built, packed and, if it is to be confidential, encrypted by whoever
   produced it. Package bodies are opaque bytes: the Server stores or refers, hashes, offers and
   serves. Unpacking, and the archive key that opens an encrypted `.7z`, belong to the Agent
   (clauses 55 and 56), so the hash an Agent verifies is the one
   the artifact was published with, and a confidential artifact is unreadable on the Server's disk.

7. **A Platform is spelled the semantic conventions' way, end to end.** The canonical Platform is an
   `os.type` value (`linux`, `darwin`, `windows`, …) and a `host.arch` value (`amd64`, `arm64`, …).
   One table in the shared crate canonicalises **both** sides before they are compared — what is
   uploaded and what an Agent reports: `macos`, `osx` → `darwin`; `win`, `win32`, `win64` →
   `windows`; `x86_64`, `x64`, `x86-64` → `amd64`; `aarch64` → `arm64`. Anything else is
   lower-cased and passed through, so a platform the table has never heard of is still served; a
   canonical token must match `[a-z0-9_]{1,16}`, which keeps it a safe file-name component. The API
   answers with the canonical pair, so a typo shows in the response. The table is compatibility,
   not translation — nothing this project produces needs it:
   - the Client reports `host.arch` as `amd64`/`arm64` and `os.type` as `darwin`, mapping Rust's
     constants, so a Supervisor and a Collector's `opampextension` report the same string;
   - the release artifacts carry the same two tokens in their file names (the file-name format is
     [ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md)'s), so the upload of a release
     is a loop over its files with `os` and `arch` read straight out of each name.

8. **A request that names bytes names their Platform; one that names the package does not.** The
   entry upload, the entry source, the entry delete and the artifact download all carry `os` and
   `arch`; creating, reading or deleting a package does not. An invalid token is `400`.

9. **Fit is mandatory, comes before everything else, and has no "unknown, so anything goes".** A
   package can be meant for an Agent only when
   - its **Agent type equals** the `service.name` the Agent reports among its identifying
     attributes — compared raw, with no canonicalisation table and no prefix or pattern, because
     there is no authority to canonicalise Agent types against and `otelcol` and `otelcol-contrib`
     are different binaries; and
   - it holds an entry for the **Platform** the Agent reports — read from `os.type` and `host.arch`,
     non-identifying attributes first and an identifying copy as fallback, canonicalised as in
     clause 7. `os.description` (prose) and `os.version` (a release, not a system) are not read.

   An Agent that reports no type, or no `os.type` or `host.arch`, fits nothing. A per-Agent rollout
   act refused on fit says which of the three it was. A label can never supply or override these
   attributes ([ADR-0026](0026-the-fleet-record.md)), so a slip there cannot hand a host an artifact
   built for another machine.

10. **The Platform does not travel on the wire.** All Agents of one type are offered the package
    under the same key, each with the download URL and content hash of the entry that fits it — two
    platforms' artifacts differ in content hash by construction — so the Client's package handling
    is identical on every target and one `[self_update]` consent works across all five release
    platforms.

11. **The Server decides which artifact an Agent receives, never a file on the host.** A
    `[[supervisor]]` block names no package; one carrying `package` fails at startup with a message
    saying the Server decides. Type fit is also the second, independent guard on the Client's own
    binary: the Server does not offer a package of another type to the Client's Agent, whatever it
    is called, and the Client still refuses an offer outside its `[self_update]` consent
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)) — one side refuses to send, the other to
    install.

12. **The store opens loudly or not at all.** At startup every package's metadata is read and every
    uploaded artifact is re-hashed by streaming. Metadata that cannot be read or parsed, an invalid
    type, version or Platform, a content hash that is not hex, a directory whose name disagrees with
    the identity its metadata states, or an artifact that no longer matches its recorded hash fails
    startup naming the file — a corrupt distribution artifact must never ship, and a store that
    silently drops a package looks like one that was never given it.

13. **Uploaded artifacts are served on the Agent plane.** The download route is the one `/api/v1`
    route on the Agent-plane listener ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)),
    not on the operator plane and not in the OpenAPI document; it streams the file and never holds
    it in memory. The offered `download_url` is a path the Client resolves against its own OpAMP
    endpoint, or `advertised_url` plus that path where downloads must go through another host.

14. **The Packages tab is one table and one detail form.** One row per package — Agent type,
    version, the platforms it holds, and where it is used. Selecting a row makes it the current
    record and shows the form; while nothing is current the form is not on screen. **Create** opens
    the form empty — the only moment the identity fields are writable. The form adds and removes
    entries in place (a file, or a source URL with its `sha256`); a file named as a release artifact
    fills the platform and, while creating, the identity. **OK** persists, **Cancel** discards, and
    both conclude the form — only a failed save keeps it open beside its message; **Delete** stands
    alone on the left. The form enforces no rule of its own: what it greys out is what the Server
    answers `409` to.

### Deployments

15. **A Package is identified by `(agent_type, version)` and nothing else.** Both are tokens of 1–64
    characters from letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `+` and `-` — no `@`, no path separator — so the pair
    embeds losslessly in a directory name and a URL. A Package has no name of its own, no Selector,
    no kind and no signature. Creating one that exists is the same request arriving twice.

16. **Two names are derived, and they answer different questions.** The **wire name** is the Agent
    type alone: the `PackagesAvailable` map key, the key an Agent reports its `PackageStatuses`
    under, and the value the Client's `[self_update] package` is compared against
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)). It must be stable across versions. The
    **display name** is `<agent_type> <version>` — the UI and the log. Using one name in both places
    would break the Client's self-update guard on every release or make the fleet view unreadable.

17. **The hashes are fixed constructions, and both are shown.** The per-package hash is
    SHA-256 over the version's length (u64, little-endian), the version, and the entry's content
    hash; the Platform has no place in it. `all_packages_hash` is SHA-256 over the Agent type's
    length, the Agent type, and that per-package hash. Each entry in the API carries its
    `content_hash` — the exact value an Agent verifies against — and its `package_hash`, the value an
    Agent echoes once in sync.

18. **Every offered Package is top-level.** `PackageType::Addon` is never emitted. The Client's
    refusal of an addon offer stays where it is (clause 51):
    it defends against a foreign Server, not against this one.

19. **The store's layout is fixed, and no other is read.** A Package is
    `<packages_dir>/<agent_type>@<version>/` holding `package.json` (identity and every entry's
    metadata) and one `<os>-<arch>.bin` per uploaded entry. The Deployments live in
    `<packages_dir>/deployments/`, armed by the same key. A loose file at the top level, or a
    directory without `package.json`, fails startup naming the path — skipping it would open a store
    that merely looks empty.

20. **The Package routes are the pair.** `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/v1/packages/{agent_type}/{version}`
    (`PUT` takes no body); `PUT|DELETE …/entries/{os}/{arch}` with the artifact as the body;
    `PUT …/entries/{os}/{arch}/source` with `{url, sha256, headers}`. `GET /api/v1/packages` lists
    each Package with its entries and the Deployments holding it. A `signature` on an entry upload or
    in a source body is refused (`400`) naming the Deployment route instead. The download is
    `GET /api/v1/packages/{agent_type}/{version}/file?os=…&arch=…` on the Agent plane. A Package has
    no Selector route and no rollout route; the OpenAPI document follows.

21. **The version test reads the claim under the Agent type**, because that is the key an Agent
    reports its status under; [ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clauses 10–13
    are otherwise unchanged.

22. **A Deployment is a name, a Selector, Packages and signatures.** The name — the one human-chosen
    label in the model — follows the grammar a Configuration's name follows: 1–32 lowercase letters,
    digits and `-`, not starting or ending with `-`, no Windows device name. The Selector is
    [ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md)'s equality pairs over the effective
    description, labels included. A Deployment is persisted as
    `<packages_dir>/deployments/<name>.json`, owner-only; a file that does not parse or whose name
    disagrees with its content fails startup naming it. `PUT /api/v1/deployments/{name}` creates it
    with `{selector}`, `PUT …/selector` re-aims it, `DELETE` removes it; saving distributes nothing.

23. **At most one Package per Agent type.** `PUT /api/v1/deployments/{name}/packages/{type}/{version}`
    adds a Package; a second one of a type already held is refused (`409`) naming the one held,
    unless the request says `?replace=true`, which swaps the version the channel holds. Writing the
    held one again succeeds. A Package the store does not hold is `404`. Two of one type would
    collide on the wire key *and* fit the same Agent; refusing at the write turns a resolution-time
    mystery into an error at the moment of the mistake — and, the collision being on the type, which
    is identity, there is no dead end where every write is refused.

24. **A Deployment's Selector is never empty, and no pair has a blank half** — `400` at creation and
    at every edit, with a message naming what to write. An empty Selector is the channel that
    collides with every other, and a forgotten field would silently become the base for the whole
    fleet.

25. **Channels are a partition by a host property, and there is no "everyone".** The Server
    prescribes no key and reserves no word. The key an operator picks says what the partition
    means — `channel` (`stable`, `beta`) for release risk, `region` for where it runs, `tenant` for
    whose it is — and keys compose as further equality pairs. Each names a property of the **host**,
    arriving from provisioning through the Client's `[attributes]` table or as a Server label, which
    moves a host between channels without touching it. An Agent no Deployment claims waits; it is
    the ordinary state of a fresh enrolment, not an error. The fleet view tells apart an Agent in no
    Deployment, one whose Deployment holds nothing it can take (no Package for its type or its
    Platform), one with something waiting, and one in conflict, because the next move differs.

26. **An Agent belongs to at most one Deployment; any overlap is a conflict.** Not the most
    specific, not the newest — none. The Agent's `package_conflict` names every Deployment that
    claims it, and it is offered nothing new until an operator narrows a Selector. There is no
    specificity rule anywhere.

27. **A conflict takes the candidate away, never a standing assignment.** An Agent already rolled
    out to keeps its offer: nothing distributes or un-distributes by itself, and creating an
    overlapping Deployment must not withdraw software from a running host.

28. **The signature lives on the Deployment, per `(Package, Platform)`, and the wire is unchanged.**
    `PUT|DELETE /api/v1/deployments/{name}/signatures/{type}/{version}/{os}/{arch}` with the hex
    Ed25519 signature (as `opamp-fleetctl package sign` prints it). A signature for a Package the Deployment
    does not hold is `404`, an empty one `400`; removing a Package from a Deployment takes its
    signatures with it. What an Agent receives in `DownloadableFile.signature` is the signature held
    by the Deployment its assignment was released through, not whichever claims it now. **The
    Server never offers a Package to an Agent unless the Deployment that releases it carries a
    signature for that Package's artifact** — the entry for the Agent's Platform. An entry without
    one is no candidate; the Agent is offered nothing for it, and the fleet view says the signature
    is missing. The Server reports, per Package, the platforms the Deployment holds a signature for.
    The same Package in two Deployments is signed in each.

29. **Rollout acts name a Deployment.** `POST /api/v1/deployments/{name}/rollout` releases to every
    Agent it claims and would move (ADR-0036 clauses 9–13), skipping Agents another Deployment also
    claims, and answers `assigned_agents`; a Deployment holding no Package is refused (`409`). **A
    Deployment that lacks a signature for any entry of any Package it holds is refused (`409`)**,
    with a message naming each such Package by its display name and the platforms it is unsigned
    for; nothing is released. The per-Agent act takes `{"deployment": "<name>"}` and is refused the
    same way. Both pin as of the press, and an Agent's package assignment is one pair — the
    Deployment it was released through and the Package pinned. A bare Package cannot be named in an
    act: that would bypass the Deployment that supplies the signature.

30. **The per-Agent act refuses to pick a side.** Naming a Deployment while a second one also claims
    the Agent is `409`, as is naming one that does not claim it. Otherwise the conflict is sidestepped
    for good, and the per-Agent path becomes the way into a state the bulk act forbids.

31. **A Deployment freezes exactly what a standing offer travels with.** Once a Deployment has
    released a Package to at least one Agent, the signatures it holds for that Package and its hold
    on that Package (removing it) are refused (`409`). The re-offer gate is the package hash, which
    does not cover the signature: a changed signature would never reach an Agent installing against
    the old one, and a removed one would silently turn a signed rollout unsigned for any Agent that
    has not finished. For the same reason **the Deployment itself cannot be deleted while an
    Agent's assignment names it** (`409`): the offer would stand without its signatures. Rolling
    those Agents out through another Deployment, or deleting the Package, ends the offer first.
    Everything else stays editable: the Selector always; adding a Package for a
    type the channel does not hold; and **swapping the version a channel holds** — the Agents
    already released keep their pinned Package, the new version shows as waiting, and the next press
    moves them. That is how a rollout proceeds.

32. **A Deployment reports three counts.** `claiming_agents` — Agents it claims and no other does;
    zero is the aim mistake worth hunting. `targeted_agents` — of those, the Agents a rollout would
    move. `conflicting_agents` — Agents it matches that another Deployment matches too. The UI shows
    "⚠ n in conflict", the "Roll out (n)" press, "n up to date", or "aims at nobody" accordingly.

33. **The bundled UI has a Deployments tab, and the Packages tab has no aim.** The Deployments tab is
    a master table and a detail form, with the per-row rollout press beside the counts — never in
    the form. The Packages tab carries no Selector, kind or reach; a Package held by no Deployment
    reads "in no deployment". An Agent in no Deployment is shown calmly.

34. **An absent assignment means nothing was rolled out.** An Agent record carrying no assignment
    fields loads as assigned nothing; the Server never invents a rollout at startup. Records are
    written as envelope version 2, and an envelope of another version stops the Server with a
    message saying to clear the agents directory.

### The wording the specification needs

[`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](../SPECIFICATION.md) outranks every ADR
([`AGENTS.md` §3](../../AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules)), so the wording this decision needs is raised here,
to be accepted or amended together with it:

> - **Package** — a versioned, downloadable software artifact an Agent installs, identified by the
>   **Agent type it is built for and its version**; its display name is derived from the two. It is
>   verified against a content hash and against a signature, and an Agent installs nothing that
>   fails either — the signature travelling with the Deployment that offers it. The Server offers
>   Packages; an Agent reports the status of each.
> - **Selector** — the rule by which the Server addresses a **subset** of the fleet for a
>   Configuration or a Deployment. One mechanism with two subjects.
> - **Deployment** — a named set of Packages, aimed at a subset of the Fleet by a Selector and
>   carrying the signature of each Package's artifact. It is the only thing that is rolled out. An
>   Agent belongs to **at most one**: two Deployments matching one Agent is a conflict, and that
>   Agent is offered nothing new until it is resolved.

**Fleet** stays as it stands — all Agents managed by the Server; that the word was taken is why
this object is called a Deployment.

### The download route and the Gateway's cache

35. **"Currently offered" is the offer's own test, shared.** An artifact `(agent_type, version,
    os, arch)` is offered to an Agent when all of the following hold:
    - the Agent declares `AcceptsPackages`;
    - it holds a package assignment naming that Package;
    - the Agent type equals the `service.name` it reports;
    - the Platform it reports, canonicalised, is the requested one, and the Package holds an
      uploaded entry for it;
    - the Deployment named in the assignment holds a signature for that entry.

    The offer and the download decide this from the same parts in `packages.rs`: one test of the
    Agent type and the Platform (`fits`), the assignment, and the signing Deployment. The download
    resolves the entry and its signers once before it takes the fleet lock, so each record costs no
    store lookup. A test that runs every combination through both keeps them from disagreeing.
    Adding the type test closes the gap against
    clause 9 in the same change.

36. **An offer stands until the assignment changes, not until it was last sent.** The hash gate
    suppresses re-sending an offer whose `all_packages_hash` the Agent has echoed
    ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 3). It does not withdraw the
    offer, so an Agent retrying after a failed install can fetch again. Neither connection state nor
    the version test ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 17) enters the
    test. Matching does not enter it either: a version that waits for an operator's press is no
    one's offer, and it cannot be fetched until the press releases it.

37. **What a certificate speaks for.** The host a member certificate names
    (`urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>`, [ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)
    clause 7) speaks for the `instance_uid`s bound to it in the host register. A host marked as a
    Gateway speaks for any Agent: the register binds no `instance_uid` to it, and the Server keeps
    no record of which Agents a Gateway carries. A Gateway's certificate therefore may fetch what is
    offered to any Agent. A certificate that names no host speaks for no Agent and fetches nothing.
    A Client whose Server signs CSRs holds a host certificate after its first connection
    ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 9). An operator who
    provisions certificates by hand names the host with that SAN URI. A Server started without
    `[client_ca]` logs one notice at startup: uploaded artifacts reach only hosts whose certificate
    names a host (`urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>`). A request that presents no certificate at all exists
    only behind `Admission::open`, which serves tests and loopback development and which no Server
    configuration serves ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 6). Such
    a request is not tested for an offer, just as it is not tested at admission.

38. **Every other request for an artifact is answered `404`, as for one that does not exist.** The
    status, the body and the headers are the same whether the store holds no such artifact, holds
    only a referenced entry for it, or holds an artifact that is not offered to any Agent this host
    speaks for. The Server decides this before it opens a file. Two answers are unchanged:
    - a malformed identity or Platform token is still `400`, which concerns syntax and reveals
      nothing about the store;
    - admission refusals (no member certificate, a bootstrap certificate, a revoked certificate)
      are still `401` ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 23).

39. **The handler decides, after it has parsed the request.** `download_package` parses the
    identity (`PackageId::new`) and the Platform (`query.platform()`) as it does now, so one parser
    decides which artifact is meant and a malformed token is answered `400` before any offer is
    tested. It then reads the host from the presented certificate: from the `PeerCertificate`
    extension through `ca::facts`, or from the `Proofs` the guard puts into the request. It asks
    the fleet `Fleet::offers_artifact(host, id, platform)`, which reads the host register
    (`Revocations::speaks_for`) and the Agent records under the fleet lock. Only after that does it
    look for the file. `admit_download` keeps only admission
    ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 23) and records
    `download.admitted` as now. A request that fails the offered test is also recorded as
    `download.refused`, outcome `refused`, with check `not offered`, the host, the certificate's
    serial and the requested type, version and Platform. That entry goes through the refusal
    aggregation of [ADR-0024](0024-an-append-only-audit-record-chained-by-hash.md) clause 5. It does
    not count toward the admission throttle
    ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 24): the handshake
    succeeded, so the refusal is not a guess at a credential, and counting it would throttle every
    member behind the same address.

40. **Each download request is counted against the requesting host's rate.** It costs one token
    from that host's bucket of [ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md). A
    download names no `instance_uid`, so for a host marked as a Gateway the token comes from the
    Gateway's aggregate bucket (ADR-0012 clause 22). That bucket bounds how often a Gateway's request
    can scan the fleet's records under the fleet lock.

41. **Configurations: no change.** An Agent already receives only its own composed map, over
    OpAMP, from what was released to it (Context). This decision states that bound for the record
    and adds nothing to it.

42. **A Gateway fetches an uploaded artifact once, when it relays its offer.** When the Gateway
    relays a `ServerToAgent` whose `packages_available` names a file on the Server's download route
    (clause 43) to an Agent, and records that offer (clause 45), it starts fetching each such
    artifact that it neither holds nor is fetching, before any downstream peer asks for it. An offer
    it does not record starts no fetch. The fetch is single-flight per artifact. The Gateway
    resolves the path against its own endpoint and fetches from its Server's origin with its own
    client certificate and no offered headers, by the rules every Client's download follows
    (clause 53). Clause 37 lets a
    marked Gateway fetch what is offered to any Agent, and each request costs one token of its
    aggregate bucket (clause 40). The message itself is forwarded unchanged and without waiting for
    the fetch (ADR-0014). At most four fetches run at a time; further ones wait for a free slot. A
    `429` or `503` from the Server with `Retry-After` defers the fetch within the bound of clause 49,
    and a deferred fetch gives its slot back while it waits and takes one again before it asks
    anew. Once its first 60 seconds have passed, a fetch is cut at the first chunk that finds it
    below an average of 64 KiB/s since then; the read timeout of clause 53 still cuts a
    silent one. A Gateway that shuts down ends its fetches, waiting or not. Any other failure — the Server's refusal (an unmarked Gateway is answered `404`,
    clause 38), a network error, a cut, bytes that do not match the hash — is logged and remembered
    for that artifact. It is fetched again only when it newly appears in an Agent's offer, that is,
    in a relayed offer to an `instance_uid` whose previous recorded offer did not name it.

43. **Only an artifact the Server hosts is cached.** An offered file is the Server's when its
    `download_url` is a path, beginning `/api/v1/packages/` and naming the route's `/file`, which
    the Server sends while `advertised_url` is unset and which a downstream Client resolves against
    its own endpoint, the Gateway. An absolute `download_url` is neither fetched nor served by the
    Gateway. For a referenced artifact's source the downstream Client fetches it as it would
    without a Gateway (clause 53). With `advertised_url` set, the Server's route is offered as an
    absolute URL naming the Server, and an uploaded artifact is not delivered behind a Gateway at
    all: the downstream Client's own origin is the Gateway, so `Sources::permit` refuses the Server's
    URL unless `[packages] allowed_sources` lists it, and if it is listed the Client presents no
    certificate there and the Server's handshake refuses it
    ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 23).

44. **The Gateway stores and serves only bytes that match the offer's hash.** An artifact is the
    offered path, query included, together with the offer's `content_hash`. The fetch streams the
    body to a staging file in the cache directory and hashes it on the way; peak memory is one
    chunk. The file is renamed into place only when its SHA-256 equals the offered
    `content_hash`; otherwise it is deleted, the mismatch is logged, and nothing is served. The
    Gateway does not check the signature. The downstream Client checks hash and signature itself
    before it installs (clause 54), so the cache cannot make an Agent install anything the
    Agent would not install from the Server.

45. **Downstream, a host receives only what the Gateway relayed to its own Agents.** The Gateway
    serves `GET /api/v1/packages/{agent_type}/{version}/file` on its downstream listener, behind
    the handshake and the revocation verdict of its `/v1/opamp`: a certificate from
    `client_ca_file` is required, a revoked one is answered `401` and every request is answered
    `503` while the Gateway holds no current list
    ([ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md) clauses 11, 14).
    - **Binding.** An `instance_uid` is bound to the host (`urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>`) of the
      certificate of the first downstream connection that reports for it since the Gateway
      started, as the Server binds an `instance_uid` to the host that first reports it
      ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 7). A report over a
      certificate that names no host binds nothing. A host holds at most `max_carried_agents`
      bindings (ADR-0014 clause 4); past that its report for a new `instance_uid` binds nothing,
      and that is logged. The Gateway holds at most 1 000 000 bindings in all; past that a new
      binding takes the place of the least recently reported binding whose `instance_uid` has
      neither a downstream route nor a current offer, and when there is none, it binds nothing,
      and that is logged. Each report refreshes when its binding was last reported.
    - **Offers.** An offer relayed to an `instance_uid` is recorded only when the downstream
      connection it is relayed over presents a certificate of the host the `instance_uid` is
      bound to; any other is not recorded, and that is logged. An Agent's current offer is the
      files of the last recorded `packages_available` relayed to it: a later one replaces it, one
      that names no Server-hosted file removes it, a message without `packages_available` leaves
      it standing (clause 36), and a downstream disconnect does not end it. The offers held are
      bounded by the offers the Server makes through the Gateway. The bindings and the offers are
      kept in memory only, and the offers are indexed by host.
    - **Requests.** A request is served only when the Gateway holds the artifact and a current
      offer of it (the same path and query, byte for byte) to an `instance_uid` bound to the host
      the request's certificate names. A certificate that names no host receives nothing. While an
      offered artifact is being fetched, or waits for a fetch slot, the request is answered `503`
      with `Retry-After: 30` instead of waiting, so a Client's read timeout does not run out while
      the Gateway fetches. An offered artifact that is neither held nor being fetched is fetched on
      a request at most once per relayed offer of it — the next relayed offer re-arms it — and that
      request is answered `503` with `Retry-After: 30`. After a failed fetch it is not fetched
      again until clause 42 says so.
    - **Everything else** is answered `404`, with the same status, headers and body whether no such
      offer was recorded, it was recorded for another host, the artifact could not be fetched or
      verified, it is too large for the cache, or the request names nothing the route knows.

    The bound on what a host receives is clause 37's, applied to what the Server sent through the
    Gateway. The binding, the `404` for an artifact too large or not fetched, and the `503` while a
    fetch runs are the Gateway's own. Together they are the one refusal beyond admission that
    ADR-0014 clause 11 allows a Gateway.

46. **The Gateway logs what it refuses; it keeps no audit record.** The audit record is the
    Server's ([ADR-0024](0024-an-append-only-audit-record-chained-by-hash.md)). A downstream
    request answered `404` because no offer of that artifact was recorded for the requesting host
    is logged at `info` with the host (or that the certificate names none), the certificate's
    serial and the requested path without its query. An offer not recorded because its
    `instance_uid` is bound to another host is logged at `warn` with both hosts. Both kinds of line
    are aggregated per host: the first five in a minute are logged one by one, and the rest of that
    minute are counted into one line when the next minute's first line for that host arrives. The
    Server records the Gateway's own fetches as it records every download (clause 39).

47. **The cache is bounded, and an artifact that does not fit is refused.**
    `[gateway] package_cache_bytes` bounds the bytes the cache holds, stages and is deleting
    together, default `10737418240` (10 GiB); `0` is refused at load. The cache lives in
    `<state_dir>/gateway-packages`, owner-only on Unix, emptied when the Gateway starts. Every
    stored copy has a file name of its own, so deleting an old copy never touches a newer copy of
    the same artifact. Before a fetch stages a byte it reserves the artifact's `Content-Length`, or
    the per-artifact limit when the Server sends none, against `package_cache_bytes`. To make room
    the Gateway first deletes artifacts no current offer names, least recently used first, and then
    offered ones, least recently used first. A file being deleted stays counted until it is gone,
    and one whose deletion fails stays counted until a later attempt deletes it. A held artifact
    whose file has disappeared is forgotten. A fetch that cannot reserve room because other fetches
    hold it fails (clause 42). On a verified rename the reservation becomes the held artifact's
    size; on failure it is released. A fetch is cut, and nothing stored, once its `Content-Length`
    or its body exceeds the smaller of `package_cache_bytes` and `max_artifact_size_bytes`; the
    Gateway logs this once per artifact and does not fetch that artifact again while it runs. Such
    an artifact is not streamed through: a downstream request for it is answered `404`
    (clause 45). No file operation runs while the cache's shared state is locked.

48. **Downstream download requests are not counted by the Gateway.** A downstream request costs a
    lookup in memory and a read from the cache directory. It reaches the Server only through the
    fetches of clauses 42 and 45: one per artifact that newly appears in an Agent's offer and is not
    held, and at most one request-triggered fetch per artifact per relayed offer. Two artifacts that
    do not fit the cache together therefore cannot evict each other in a loop driven by requests.
    Each request to the Server costs a token of the Gateway's aggregate bucket (clause 40). As on
    `/v1/opamp`, the Gateway applies no rate of its own.

49. **A Client waits as its own Server origin asks before it reports a download failed.** A `429`
    or `503` with a `Retry-After` in seconds, answered by the Client's own Server origin — the
    Gateway behind one, otherwise the Server, whose rate limit answers `429` with `Retry-After: 30`
    ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md) clause 24, whose follow-up this
    is) and whose admission throttle answers `429` with the seconds of back-off left
    ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 24) — is waited out and the
    download sent again. Each wait is the `Retry-After`, at least 1 second and at most 60 seconds.
    The asking stops 30 minutes after the first request of the download, counting the requests as
    well as the waits: a wait that would end past that point is not begun. Past it, or for a
    `429`/`503` without a `Retry-After` in seconds — an HTTP date, none, or an unreadable one — or
    from any other host, a redirect target off the Server's origin included, the download fails as
    before and is reported `InstallFailed`
    (clause 52). While it waits the
    status stays `Downloading`. The bound is on asking, not on a transfer that has begun, which
    keeps no total timeout (clause 53). A Client that shuts down stops waiting and reports
    nothing for that download.

### Delivery on the Agent

50. **The Supervisor is the updater, and only a Client holding a verification key takes
    packages.** With `[packages] verification_key` set, every Supervisor-backed Agent declares
    `AcceptsPackages` and `ReportsPackageStatuses` (every Managed Process is one this Client
    installed, [ADR-0032](0032-supervisor-mode-kinds-directories-and-what-the-server-may-change.md)). Without it, no Agent of
    this Client declares `AcceptsPackages` — neither a Supervisor nor the Client's own Agent
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)) — and the Client says so at startup, once,
    naming `[packages] verification_key` as what to set. A package offered to such an Agent
    regardless is ignored: nothing is downloaded, and an Agent that declared no package capability
    reports no package status. A verified artifact travels to the Supervisor as the Port command
    `ProcessCommand::ApplyPackage { staged, version, hash }`, answered by
    `ProcessEvent::PackageApplied`, beside `ApplyConfig`/`ConfigApplied`. No further process is
    spawned for it.

51. **One top-level package per Agent; anything else is refused and reported.** An Agent takes the
    one top-level package of an offer. An offer carrying only addons, or two top-level packages, is
    refused with a reason in `PackageStatuses.error_message` and nothing is downloaded — the
    Baseline lets any Server offer addons, and a Supervisor's only use for a package is to *be* the
    program, so the filter guards against a non-conforming peer writing an addon over the binary.
    An offer whose per-package hash equals the installed one is acknowledged by echoing the
    aggregate hash; a repeat of the hash already in flight is ignored.

52. **Status follows the Baseline lifecycle, and every outcome ends the offer.** While the bytes
    arrive the status is `Downloading` with `PackageDownloadDetails` (percent from
    `Content-Length`, `0` when unknown, and bytes per second); otherwise a taken offer is
    `Installing`, with `agent_has_version` still the old one; the Supervisor's answer makes it
    `Installed` or `InstallFailed` with the reason. A failed download or verification is
    `InstallFailed` too. Success *and* failure echo the offered `all_packages_hash`, so the Server
    stops re-offering the same bytes: a refusal is a report, not a loop. The installed package
    (name, version, hash) is persisted in the Agent's state, so a restarted Client reports what it
    runs and is not offered it again.

53. **The download is streamed, bounded, staged inside the Supervisor's own directory, and goes
    only to an allowed source.**
    - `download_url` is used as given when it is absolute `https://`; a path is resolved against
      the Server's own origin — the scheme, host and port of the Client's OpAMP endpoint, `wss`
      mapped to `https` (and `ws` to `http`, which the endpoint may only be on the loopback).
    - A source is `https://`. `http://` is accepted only when its host is the IP literal
      `127.0.0.1` or `::1`; a host name is never the loopback, `localhost` included. Every
      download is TLS 1.3, on the Client's TLS trust.
    - `[packages] allowed_sources` lists `https://` URL prefixes (`http://` only on a loopback IP
      literal), validated at startup: an entry with another scheme, a plaintext entry off the
      loopback, or an entry carrying credentials, a query or a fragment fails startup naming it. A
      URL matches an entry when scheme, host and port are equal and its path begins with the
      entry's path at a `/` boundary. The Server's own origin is always allowed and needs no entry;
      the list defaults to empty, which allows the Server's own origin alone.
    - The source is checked before the request is sent: a URL that is not allowed is refused
      without a byte fetched, and reported `InstallFailed` naming its origin.
    - The offered package name must be 1–64 characters of letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `+`, `-`,
      checked before anything is resolved or written: the staged file is named after it.
    - The artifact is streamed to `<supervisor_dir>/packages/<name>.staged` and hashed on the way;
      peak memory is one chunk. The staging directory is owner-only (`0700` on Unix), so no other
      local user can swap the file between verification and install. A failure leaves no partial
      file.
    - `max_artifact_size_bytes` (top level of `supervisor.toml`, default `1073741824`, `0` fails
      startup) bounds the download: a `Content-Length` above it is refused before a byte is written,
      and a chunked body is cut the moment it crosses it.
    - Connect timeout 30 s and read timeout 60 s, never a total timeout — a large artifact over a
      slow link legitimately takes minutes.
    - Redirects are followed up to 5, and every hop is checked against the scheme rule and the
      allow-list before it is requested; a hop outside them fails the download, naming the origin it
      pointed at. The offer's `headers` are sent on the `GET` only to an allowed source, and re-sent
      along a redirect only while scheme, host and port stay the ones they were given for; an
      invalid header fails the download naming its key only. Header values never reach a log or a
      debug print, and the logged source URL drops its query, fragment and credentials.
    - The Client presents its client certificate only to the Server's own origin, whose download
      route is reached through the Agent plane's TLS handshake and stays outside the credential check
      ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md),
      [ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)). To any other
      host, and on a hop that leaves the Server's origin, it presents none: an identity belongs to
      the Server, not to whoever hosts an artifact.

54. **Verification decides, and the signature is mandatory.** The SHA-256 of the streamed bytes
    must equal `content_hash`, always. The Ed25519 signature must then verify against
    `[packages] verification_key` (hex-encoded Ed25519 public key, decoded at startup; a malformed
    key fails startup), always. An offer with no signature is refused before anything is
    downloaded; an invalid signature refuses the artifact. Both checks complete on the staged
    bytes before the artifact is opened, so an unverified archive is never parsed beyond its hash
    and signature. There is no unsigned posture: a Client without a key takes no packages (clause
    50). The signature covers a statement of what the artifact is, not its bytes:
    `opamp-fleet-package-v1`, the Agent type (the offered package's name), the version and the
    artifact's SHA-256 in lowercase hex, one per line, each ended by a newline
    (`fleet_core::package::statement`). `opamp-fleetctl package sign --agent-type … --version …` makes
    it. Since the hash is in the statement and checked against the streamed bytes first, the
    signature still covers the artifact exactly as published, archive and all — and holds for that
    type and version alone. Where a Deployment
    keeps the signature is clause 28. The same download and
    verification serve the Client's own update ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)).

55. **The Agent opens the artifact; nothing between its author and the host repacks it.** The hash
    an Agent verifies is therefore the SHA-256 the artifact was published with — integrity runs in
    one line from the release page to the running program. What an artifact is, is decided by its
    leading bytes, never by a name: `1f 8b` is a `.tar.gz`; `37 7a bc af 27 1c` is a `.7z`;
    `PK\x03\x04` or `PK\x05\x06` is a `.zip`; anything else is the program itself. These three
    containers are the whole set the Client opens, for every kind and for its own update alike.
    A `.deb`, `.rpm` or `.msi` is not opened.

56. **A `.7z` may be encrypted, and the key lives only on the Agent.** `[packages] archive_key`
    opens an encrypted `.7z` (AES-256); the Server never learns it, so a confidential artifact is
    readable only on the host that runs it. It is one secret for the fleet — a single archive serves
    every Agent — and must never be the `[auth]` credential, which the Server rotates on its own
    ([ADR-0013](0013-connection-settings-offered-without-a-credential-and-server-capabilities.md)) and would leave every archive
    unopenable. It is masked in the configuration the Client reports. An encrypted archive without
    the key, or with the wrong one, fails naming the key. A `.zip` is never encrypted: an encrypted
    zip member refuses the archive and names `.7z` as the way.

57. **A single-file package installs one member, to a place the Client chose.** Without
    `program_path`, the artifact is the program or an archive holding it: the member whose *file
    name* equals the configured program's is extracted, wherever the archive keeps it, and nothing
    else. The archive never chooses a path, so a member named `../../etc/cron.d/x` lands where the
    Client put it like any other. A missing member fails, naming up to eight members the archive
    does hold. Output is bounded at 2 GiB, and the decompression needed to *reach* the member is
    bounded by the same budget from the declared sizes before anything inflates, so a bomb ahead
    of the target is refused rather than skipped through.

58. **A `[[supervisor]]` block's `program_path` makes the package a directory tree.** It is a
    relative path *inside* the package, e.g. `bin/fluent-bit`; absent, the package is one file. It
    is validated at startup — non-empty, relative, no `.` or `..` — and it says *where inside*,
    never *whether*: the program's bare file name stays the consent
    ([ADR-0032](0032-supervisor-mode-kinds-directories-and-what-the-server-may-change.md)). Being written in the
    configuration, the spawn path `program/tree/<program_path>` is known before any package exists.
    - `program_path` matches a member by its **trailing path components**, so `bin/fluent-bit`
      finds `fluent-bit-3.1.0/bin/fluent-bit` and stays right at the next release. No match fails
      naming what the archive holds; several matches fail naming them, answered by writing more of
      the path.
    - The directory prefix above the match is stripped, and every member below it is extracted
      keeping its relative path. Members outside that prefix are not unpacked; they are counted in
      the install line and named at `debug`.
    - A bare program delivered to a tree Supervisor is placed at `program_path`.

59. **A tree's paths are sanitized and its size is bounded, or nothing is written.** Every member
    is checked before the first byte lands. An absolute path, a root or drive prefix, a `..`
    component, a symbolic or hard link, or a 7z anti-item refuses the **whole** archive — a
    partially unpacked agent is worse than none. Extraction is bounded at 2 GiB across all members
    and at 10 000 members, from declared sizes before decompression and again on what is written.

60. **Modes come from a `.tar.gz` on Unix; the program is always made executable.** A tar's member
    modes are applied. A `.7z` or `.zip` carries Windows attributes, so no mode is taken from it.
    The program — the single file or the member at `program_path` — is set `0755` regardless, so
    whether it can run never depends on how the archive was built; an agent with further
    executables beside its program ships as `.tar.gz`.

61. **The swap is a rename, and the apply grace gates it.** On disk, per Supervisor:

    | Package | Live | Predecessor | Staged |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | single file | `program/<file>` | `program/<file>.rollback` | `program/<file>.staged` |
    | tree | `program/tree/` | `program/tree.rollback/` | `program/.staging/` |

    The artifact is unpacked to the staged name first, beside what runs; a raw artifact is moved
    there rather than copied when it can be. A kind that declares a preflight proves the staged
    program runs before anything is stopped ([ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)). Then the Managed
    Process is stopped, the live name renamed to the predecessor, the staged name renamed to the
    live one — so the live name is always the old package or the new one, never a mixture — and
    the process is spawned and must survive `apply_grace_secs`
    ([ADR-0032](0032-supervisor-mode-kinds-directories-and-what-the-server-may-change.md)). Surviving is `Installed`, after which the
    program is asked for its version again. A spawn failing with `ETXTBSY` right after the swap is
    retried briefly rather than rolled back. When there is nothing to run yet (no Configuration),
    the package is installed and reported `Installed`; the configuration that arrives starts it.

62. **A failed apply rolls back only to a predecessor.** If the process does not start or exits
    within the grace and a predecessor exists, the predecessor is renamed back over the live name
    and respawned. If there is none — a first install — nothing is rolled back: the verified
    program stays in place and is reported `InstallFailed`. A failure never empties `program/`, so
    the "installed ≠ offered, re-offer, re-download" loop cannot start.

63. **A program that keeps failing to start is held, not looped.** A start counts as failed when
    the apply fails its grace, or the process exits before it has run `max(apply_grace, 10 s)`.
    After **three** failed
    starts in a row the Supervisor stops restarting, reports the Agent unhealthy (`not restarting:
    the program keeps failing to start`) and waits. A new Configuration, a new package or a
    restart command is a fresh chance and resets the count; a run that outlasted the floor resets
    it too. This holds for a failed package, a rolled-back predecessor that will not start either,
    and a Configuration alike. Three is the self-update's give-up
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)), so the two update paths behave alike.

64. **The superseded version is kept for a window, then deleted.** After a successful apply the
    predecessor stays, and a marker beside it (`<predecessor>.until`, Unix seconds) records
    `now + retain_previous_secs`. A sweep at startup and every 10 minutes deletes a predecessor
    past its deadline; a marker that will not parse counts as expired, and a predecessor without a
    marker is left alone. `[updates] retain_previous_secs` sets the window (default `86400`, one
    day); a `[[supervisor]]` block's `retain_previous_secs` overrides it for that Supervisor;
    negative values fail startup; `0` deletes the predecessor on success. A Supervisor keeps at
    most one predecessor: the next update replaces it and its marker. The marker lives in the
    Supervisor's directory, so the deadline survives a Client restart.

65. **A Supervisor takes its own type, and never goes back.** An offered package whose name is not
    the Supervisor's Agent type is refused before anything is downloaded, and so is one whose
    version precedes the installed one by Semantic Versioning's precedence. Versions that do not
    compare are not refused on that ground; the signature still binds them. The Client's own
    update keeps its own rules ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)).

**Out of scope:** which package reaches which Agent and when
([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md)); verifying upstream sigstore/cosign
signatures; a retention policy for superseded Packages; Deployments carrying Configurations;
inequality in Selectors; refusing an overlapping Selector at write time; whether
`[self_update] package` should be renamed, since its value is an Agent type; addons, and
installing them, until a Client can install one; who can fetch an artifact hosted elsewhere — a
referenced entry (`source`) is fetched from the operator's host under `[packages]
allowed_sources`, with whatever headers the offer carries (clauses 4 and 53), the Server is not in
that download path, who can fetch from that host is decided there, and a Gateway does not cache
such an artifact (clause 43); a bound finer than the host
([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 14); roles, permissions and
tenancy on the Operator plane; keeping the Gateway's cache and the offers it serves across a
restart of the Gateway, and the Gateway's own Supervisors fetching through the cache; resuming an
interrupted download with range requests; distributing the archive key, the verification key or
the allow-list; keeping more than one predecessor; scoping an offered header to a path below an
allowed origin.

## Alternatives considered

- **Leave the platform or the type to the operator's aim.** `os.type`/`host.arch`/`service.name`
  pairs already filter at zero cost. Rejected: opt-in, and forgetting it installs a foreign binary
  on every host of every other platform or type. A rule that is only right when remembered is not
  the rule this needs.
- **An optional Platform meaning "every platform".** The backward-compatible reading of a filter;
  rejected because it makes the guarantee a property of how carefully something was uploaded rather
  than of the Server.
- **Platform as metadata on separate package names** (`otelcol-linux-amd64`). Smaller, but five
  artifacts then need five names and every host a matching name in its own configuration — the
  per-host wiring this store exists to remove, at the one place where the blast radius is the
  Client itself.
- **A version per platform entry.** Allows a per-platform rollout of different versions under one
  object, and is indistinguishable from a half-finished upload. Two packages express that case
  explicitly.
- **Encode the platform in the version** (`3.0.0+linux-amd64`). Needs no schema, and contradicts
  [ADR-0011](0011-versions-resolved-in-the-internal-crate.md): build metadata is provenance and is not compared.
- **Canonicalise onto what Rust reports** (`x86_64`, `aarch64`). The smaller change; rejected
  because it makes this project's canonical spelling one that neither the conventions, nor the
  Collector, nor the release artifact uses — a private vocabulary maintained by a table, forever.
- **Reject unknown `os`/`arch` tokens against a closed list.** Catches a typo, and refuses to serve
  any platform the list forgot. The canonical pair in the response covers the typo far cheaper.
- **Canonicalise or pattern-match Agent types.** There is no authority to canonicalise against; a
  table would encode this project's opinion of every distribution, and a pattern is a matching
  language that outlives its convenience.
- **Default the type to a name**, so no extra input is needed. Right most of the time and silently
  wrong for every name chosen for a rollout rather than a target.
- **Remember one previous version per package and roll back by swapping.** Bounded disk, one button
  — but hidden, one step deep, and a second history beside the store. Keeping every version as its
  own package makes the history the store itself.
- **Import a URL: have the Server download it and serve the bytes.** Better in a fleet whose hosts
  cannot reach the internet — and that is exactly what uploading is. As the behaviour of a URL it
  makes the Server hold and expose artifacts it has no need to hold.
- **Derive the checksum by fetching once, or verify the reference by downloading at set time.**
  Records what the Server happened to receive, from where it stands — trust on first use with no
  anchor, and for a reference not even what the Agents get.
- **Plaintext referenced urls to LAN mirrors.** An HTTP file share on the operator's network is
  the cheapest mirror, and the `sha256` (and a signature where the Agent holds a key) already
  protects what an Agent installs. Rejected: a hash or a signature protects integrity, not
  confidentiality — the artifact and, worse, the download credential in `headers` would cross the
  network readable to anyone on it, and the specification accepts plaintext on the loopback alone.
- **An opaque identifier instead of readable tokens.** Robust against any character, meaningless in
  a URL, a file name and the UI; a bounded token grammar buys the same safety.
- **Keep a name as an optional field defaulting to the Agent type.** Smallest change; the room it
  leaves is the problem — the degree of freedom that needed a ranking.
- **Identity `(name, version)` with the type as an attribute.** The type decides fit, and an
  attribute is editable; retyping stored bytes to another kind of Agent is what immutable identity
  forecloses.
- **Keep the addon kind, and its byte in the hash, against a future need.** No Client installs an
  addon and no artifact here is one; with nothing deployed the byte buys no stability and leaves an
  unexplained constant in a hash function.
- **Keep specificity and move it to the Deployment.** Preserves the fleet-wide-plus-canary shape and
  the unreadable computation with it; the requirement is a partition.
- **An empty Selector as a catch-all that loses to every other.** A ranking one level deep, makes
  forgetting a field the way to target the whole fleet, and overlaps everything by construction.
- **Inequality in Selectors (`key != value`).** Most expressive; the operator keeps exclusions in
  sync by hand, overlap stops being visible by eye, and it changes the Selector for Configurations
  too. Named as a follow-up if the partition proves too rigid.
- **Naming a Deployment in the per-Agent act resolves the conflict.** Makes the conflict permanently
  liveable; a rule that can be waived per Agent is not a partition.
- **Deployments carry Configurations too.** The tidier end state, and a second lifecycle with its own
  revision model; deferred.
- **Signatures stay on the artifact, and the Deployment names only the required key.** No
  re-signing when a Package moves, but it puts an attribute back on the emptied object and the
  release decision back on the bytes.
- **The Server accepts unsigned Deployments.** An unsigned fleet as a legitimate policy, reported
  rather than refused; it is the convenience the specification ranks below security, and it rolls
  out software the Agent would install with nothing proving who released it.
- **Keep a reader for older store and record shapes.** A migration with no source is untestable in
  the only way that matters and untrue as documentation.
- **Leave the route open to every member.** This is the status quo. Membership becomes a key to
  every build the store holds, including builds released to another partition and builds released
  to no one yet. It also lets a compromised host list the store. The cost of closing it is one
  lookup per download.
- **Answer `403` for an artifact that exists but is not offered.** This is the more literal status
  code, but it tells a host which type, version and Platform the store holds, which is the
  enumeration this decision closes. RFC 9110 explicitly allows `404` for this purpose.
- **Bind the fetch to an Agent instead of the host**, by naming an `instance_uid` in the
  `download_url` or in a header. The `instance_uid` is self-asserted, and the only thing the
  Server can check against is the host binding. The result is the same bound with an extra request
  parameter that the Baseline's `DownloadableFile` does not need.
- **Signed, expiring download URLs**, like pre-signed object-store links. Whoever holds the URL
  can fetch, and the URL ends up in logs. The Server would need a signing key and its rotation.
  An expiry would also conflict with a retry after a failed install, which re-reads an offer the
  hash gate no longer re-sends. The handshake already identifies the host.
- **Allow whatever is a candidate for the host's Agents** (what matching would release now). This
  would let a host fetch a build the operator saved but did not release. That breaks the rule that
  a release happens only by an operator's act
  ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md) clause 1).
- **Limit a Gateway to the Agents currently carried on its connections.** The Server would have to
  track which connection or host carries each Agent, which it does not do today: the register
  binds nothing to a Gateway, and `owner` is a WebSocket connection id. That tracking would buy
  nothing, because a Gateway's certificate may report under any `instance_uid`
  ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 14) and so can receive any
  Agent's offer over OpAMP anyway.
- **Treat a certificate that names no host as membership alone**, able to fetch anything offered.
  This would keep downloads unchanged for hand-provisioned certificates without the SAN URI. But it
  removes the bound for exactly the certificates the register cannot track.
- **Bind certificates that name no host by their issuer and serial**, as
  [ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md) keys its buckets, so that a hand-provisioned certificate speaks for the Agents that
  reported with it. This would keep G-10 working without changes for a fleet whose Server signs no
  CSRs. It was not chosen. It means a second binding register next to the host register, and its
  entries would have to be carried across certificate replacements that the Server never sees,
  because without `[client_ca]` the Server does not issue the next certificate. The bound would
  also lapse whenever an operator replaces a certificate by hand. The G-10 cost of declining it
  falls on such fleets: they deliver uploaded artifacts only after their certificates name a host,
  and referenced artifacts are unaffected.
- **Check the offer in the `admit_download` middleware.** The middleware would have to parse the
  path and query a second time, and could answer "not offered" for a request the handler would
  have answered `400`. Two parsers could disagree on which artifact is meant.
- **Count `not offered` refusals toward the admission throttle.** That throttle counts a peer
  address, so one misbehaving host would throttle every member behind a shared address. The record
  already holds the refusals, aggregated.
- **Relay the download route through the Gateway, request by request.** The Gateway would fetch
  with its own certificate for every downstream request, so the bytes would cross the Gateway's
  link once per Agent, and every request would cost a token of its aggregate bucket (Context). It
  would also need the same downstream bound as the cache, because the Gateway's certificate
  fetches what is offered to any Agent.
- **Fetch on the first downstream request instead of when the offer is relayed.** Simpler by one
  trigger, but the artifact would only start to cross the link once an Agent asks, and every Agent
  behind the Gateway would be answered `503` for the whole transfer. Fetching when the offer passes
  starts the transfer as early as the Gateway can know it is needed.
- **Let a downstream request wait for the fetch instead of answering `503`.** The Client's read
  timeout of 60 seconds also bounds the wait for the response's headers. A fetch over a slow link
  outlasts it, the Client reports the download failed and echoes the offer's hash, and the Server
  does not offer it again (clause 52). A `503` with `Retry-After` keeps the Client asking
  within the bound of clause 49.
- **Bind an `instance_uid` on the first offer the Gateway relays for it.** A host that reports
  another host's `instance_uid` between that host's report and the Server's reply would be bound
  instead. The first report is what the Server binds on as well.
- **Rewrite the offer's `download_url` to name the Gateway.** That would make an absolute URL
  cacheable too, but the Gateway forwards messages unchanged (ADR-0014), and a Gateway that edits
  what the Server offers is one more place an offer can be made to say something the Server did
  not.
- **Serve whatever the Gateway holds to any admitted downstream peer.** Admission behind a Gateway
  is fleet membership, as at the Server. Any member behind the Gateway could fetch another
  partition's build once one Agent behind the same Gateway was offered it, which clause 37 closes
  at the Server.
- **Bind a downstream fetch to the connection that carries the Agent instead of its host.** A
  plain-HTTP Client opens a new exchange for every report, a WebSocket Client reconnects, and an
  Agent retrying a failed install may do so on a later connection (clause 36). The host is the bound
  the Server applies, and the one the certificate states.
- **Stream an artifact too large for the cache through without storing it.** The Gateway would
  pass on bytes before their hash is checked, and every downstream request for that artifact would
  become an upstream fetch, which the cache exists to prevent. An operator who rolls out such an
  artifact behind a Gateway raises `package_cache_bytes`; the refusal is logged.
- **Count downstream download requests in a bucket per downstream host.** It would add a rate the
  Gateway does not apply on `/v1/opamp` either (ADR-0014 clause 11). A downstream request reaches
  the Server at most as the one shared fetch, so the Server's bucket for the Gateway already bounds
  what downstream requests cost upstream.
- **Cache referenced artifacts as well.** The Gateway would need the offered headers, which are an
  operator's credential for one host, and would present them from a second host; the Client
  presents them only to the source they were given for (clause 53). A referenced source is
  the operator's own download server and can be placed near the Agents.
- **Keep the cache and its offers on disk across a restart.** It saves one fetch per artifact
  after a restart, but a persisted offer outlives what the Server last said, and the bound of
  clause 45 would have to be trusted across a process the Gateway does not control. An emptied
  directory and offers in memory need no reconciliation.
- **A Client-side downgrade refusal alone, the signature left over the bytes** — keeps every
  existing signature valid, but a signed artifact of one type stays installable as another's
  program.
- **The type and version in a detached manifest, signed beside the artifact** — a second file to
  carry and keep in step; the statement is a few dozen bytes the Client builds from what the offer
  already says.
- **A separate Updater process for Managed-Process packages**, symmetric with the Client's own
  update. The Supervisor already is a distinct process that owns stop, swap, spawn and health
  gate; another process would buy nothing.
- **Content hash only, signatures later.** Authenticity is what verifying a binary means, and
  retrofitting it onto an install path is the costly change; Ed25519 through the `ring` already
  present costs little.
- **Unsigned operation as a posture of the operator's**, accepted on the content hash with a
  warning at startup. The hash arrives in the same offer as the URL, so whoever can make the offer
  — a compromised Server, a stolen operator login — chooses both and runs code on every host it
  reaches. The specification installs software only when it is signed with a key the operator
  holds, and a warning is the convenience it puts second.
- **Refuse startup without a verification key.** A Client that only applies configurations would
  have to hold a key it never uses. Not declaring `AcceptsPackages` installs nothing unsigned just
  as surely, and says so at startup.
- **An open download policy: any `https://` source, the hash and signature deciding.** Verification
  protects the host, not what a download presents: the offered headers and, toward the Server, the
  client certificate would go wherever an offer or a redirect points, and the Client would fetch
  from any host its network reaches on a Server's word. An allow-list bounds both at the cost of a
  list the operator keeps.
- **Allow-list hosts instead of URL prefixes.** One origin often serves several tenants or
  projects (a release host, an artifact repository); a prefix confines the Client to the operator's
  part of it. A raw string prefix is not used either: `https://mirror.example` would match
  `https://mirror.example.attacker.net`, so a match compares the origin exactly and the path at a
  segment boundary.
- **Check only the first URL, not every redirect hop.** A mirror on the list could then send the
  download, and the headers re-attached on its own origin, anywhere.
- **Present the client certificate to every source.** It would hand the Client's fleet identity to
  a mirror that has no use for it, and to every host a redirect reaches.
- **Unpack on the Server and store a bare binary.** One extraction instead of hundreds, no
  unpacking code on hosts. Rejected: the Server would re-hash its own output, so every Agent would
  verify a number the Server invented instead of the one upstream published, and an encrypted
  artifact would have to be decrypted on the Server — key and plaintext on the very machine the
  encryption keeps them from.
- **Support only `.7z`** (one code path, carries a password). Upstream publishes no `.7z`, so no
  release could be used without repacking by hand. **Only `.tar.gz` with some outer encryption**
  — a format someone would have to invent, where AES-256 `.7z` is understood by every tool.
- **The archive key in `server.toml`, distributed over OpAMP, or carried as a Configuration.** Each
  puts the key where the Server — whose download route anyone who can reach it may call — can open
  every artifact; as a Configuration it would also be echoed back as effective configuration and
  shown in the fleet view.
- **Addon packages for an agent's supplementary files.** Nothing groups a set of packages, so there
  is no consistent version, no ordering and no atomicity: an Agent could sit with a new executable
  and old shared objects.
- **A `strip_components` key, or stripping a lone top directory automatically.** The first is one
  more number to get right by inspecting an artifact; the second flattens an archive whose top
  level is meaningful and changes behaviour with the archive's contents. Suffix matching needs
  nothing written and fails loudly when ambiguous.
- **Find the program by searching the unpacked tree.** It removes "what will this host run" from
  the configuration: before the first package there is nothing to search.
- **A self-extracting single file.** Re-extracts on every update, hides what is installed, makes
  the reported version the wrapper's, and turns rollback into hope.
- **Unpack over the live `program/` in place.** A failed unpack halfway leaves a tree that is
  neither version and destroys the predecessor the health gate rolls back to.
- **A version-named directory and a `current` pointer** for trees. A directory rename is atomic on
  every platform the Client runs on; a pointer is a symlink on Unix and a junction on Windows —
  machinery that would run on every package. Two fixed names are the single-file swap one level
  up; the version is read from the Agent's report, not from disk.
- **Keep every superseded version.** An unbounded version store on hosts chosen for their disk
  budget; a rollback needs one predecessor.
- **Give up after one failed start.** A transient failure — a briefly held port — would strand a
  rollout; three matches the self-update.
- **Retention on the downloaded artifact instead of the installed predecessor.** A rollback restores
  the installed program, not the download; tying retention to the staged file would delete what a
  fallback needs.

## Sources / Prior art

- [OpAMP specification § Packages (`v0.19.0`)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-spec/blob/v0.19.0/specification.md),
  also [§ Packages, Downloadable Packages, Code Signing](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-spec/blob/main/specification.md#packages)
  — the hash-gated sync and the status lifecycle; `PackagesAvailable` is "the packages that are
  available on the Server **for this Agent**", maps a name to one version and hash *for this
  Agent*, carries `signature` per downloadable file, and expects "normally only one top-level
  package"; the Download Server "may be on the same host as the OpAMP Server or a different host";
  one downloadable file per package, multiple files to be carried "in any file format that allows
  storing multiple files in a single file"; and what a package contains "is Agent type-specific and
  is outside the concerns of the OpAMP protocol".
- [OpAMP specification v0.20.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-spec/blob/v0.20.0/specification.md),
  section *Packages*: "The PackagesAvailable message describes the packages that are available on
  the Server for this Agent". Its URLs "point to package files on a Download Server (which may be on
  the same host as the OpAMP Server or a different host)". Section *Downloading Packages*, step 3:
  the Agent uses "an HTTP GET message" with the offered headers. Section *Packages / Security
  Considerations* and section *Security* say nothing about which Agent may fetch which file. This
  decision fills that gap on the Server and changes nothing on the wire.
- The vendored schema `crates/opamp/proto/v0.20.0/opamp/v1/opamp.proto`: `PackagesAvailable` is
  the "List of packages that the Server offers to the Agent"; `DownloadableFile.download_url`.
- The Baseline's `AgentDescription` — "keys/values are according to OpenTelemetry semantic
  conventions", `os.type` SHOULD be included, `service.name` "uniquely identifies the Agent type".
- [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions — `host.arch`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/registry/attributes/host.md)
  and [`os.type`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/registry/attributes/os.md)
  — the canonical token sets adopted in clause 7.
- [`opampextension`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/extension/opampextension/opamp_agent.go)
  — reports `os.type` from `runtime.GOOS` and `host.arch` from `runtime.GOARCH`.
- [OCI Image Index](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md) — one
  reference resolves to a list of manifests, each with a required `platform` object, values from
  Go's `GOOS`/`GOARCH`; pushed digests are immutable.
- [Debian repository format](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format) and
  [RPM repositories](https://rpm-software-management.github.io/) — a released package is
  `(name, version, architecture)` with per-file checksums. With the OCI Image Index: the name *is*
  what the software is; nothing carries a second identity beside it.
- [`opentelemetry-collector-releases` v0.157.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/tag/v0.157.0)
  — archives only, never a bare binary; `checksums.txt` with a SHA-256 per asset; sigstore keyless
  `.sig`/`.pem` companions.
- [Bindplane — Bring Your Own Collector](https://docs.bindplane.com/feature-guides/deployment-and-management/bring-your-own-collector)
  — the Agent type as a first-class object reported by the collector, not a free-form tag.
- [`opamp-go`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-go) — its example Server offers no packages,
  so there is no upstream behaviour to copy for where artifacts come from or whom they reach; its
  `PackagesSyncer` is the reference download-verify-report component.
- [Collector Supervisor specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/cmd/opampsupervisor/specification/README.md)
  — signs the package hash server-side and verifies before applying.
- [WSUS update approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-server-update-services/deploy/3-approve-and-deploy-updates-in-wsus)
  — approval binds a concrete update to a **computer group**: membership, never exclusion.
- [Jamf Pro patch policies](https://learn.jamf.com/r/en-US/jamf-pro-documentation-current/Patch_Policies)
  — one version bound to a scope built from groups.
- [Bindplane rollouts](https://docs.bindplane.com/feature-guides/deployment-and-management/rollouts)
  — deployment starts on an explicit act and names a pinned version.
- [Argo CD manual sync](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/auto_sync/) — drift
  displayed, nothing applied until Sync; the waiting view extended to "in no Deployment".
- [Kubernetes label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
  — set-based selectors have `NotIn` and `DoesNotExist`, and grouping still leans on membership
  labels.
- [RFC 9110 §15.5.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15.5.4): "An origin server

  with a status code of 404 (Not Found)."
- [nginx `ngx_http_proxy_module`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html),
  `proxy_cache_lock`: "only one request at a time will be allowed to populate a new cache element
  … Other requests of the same cache element will either wait for a response to appear in the
  cache or the cache lock for this element to be released". `proxy_cache_path` `max_size`: when
  the size is exceeded the cache manager "removes the least recently used data". The single-flight
  fetch and the LRU bound of clauses 42 and 47 follow that established shape, with offers deciding
  what is evicted first.

- [`sevenz-rust2`](https://crates.io/crates/sevenz-rust2) — pure-Rust 7z with an `aes256` feature;
  its default features pull `bzip2`, so it is taken with `default-features = false`.

## Consequences

- Positive: a release is one object — five platforms' artifacts under one identity with one
  version. One upload loop per release, no per-host configuration, and the Client's self-update
  works across a heterogeneous fleet.
- Positive: a mismatched binary is refused by construction rather than caught by a health gate; the
  Client's own binary is protected on both sides of the wire.
- Positive: one spelling of a platform from the release file name through the upload, the API, the
  fleet view and what a Collector reports; folding a Managed Process's attributes over the
  Supervisor's cannot change a host's architecture.
- Positive: a package can be a URL an operator already has — nothing uploaded, nothing duplicated —
  and for a referenced entry nothing exists on the Server to leak.
- Positive: a referenced entry's headers and artifact never cross a network in plaintext; the only
  plaintext source is one on the host itself.
- Negative / trade-offs: a mirror on the operator's network needs a certificate its Agents trust;
  a plain HTTP file share is no longer a source.
- Negative / trade-offs: disk is unbounded by design — every version stays until deleted.
- Negative / trade-offs: a mistyped Agent type is a silent no-op — there is no canonicalisation to
  catch it, and the package simply fits nobody. An Agent's type can change under a stable
  configuration (a Collector gaining `opampextension` switches to `dist.name`), and with it which
  packages fit it.
- Negative / trade-offs: an Agent reporting no platform or no type gets no package. No Client this
  project ships is in that position; a foreign OpAMP client may be.
- Negative / trade-offs: a referenced entry needs egress from every Agent to its source, three
  hundred downloads from a third party, and the Server cannot answer what exactly the Agents will
  install — a wrong hash, a moved release or a revoked token surfaces as `InstallFailed` on Agents.
  Headers for a private source are a fleet-wide secret in flight and at rest on every host.
- Positive: "what is this artifact" is readable off one object with two fields, and "which artifact
  does this host get" off one Deployment. The ranking disappears — specificity, the version
  tie-break and the unbreakable tie. A collision between two Deployments is **refused and named**
  rather than silently resolved; that is a discipline, not a proof that one Deployment matches.
- Positive: a channel is something an operator can name, sign and release in one act.
- Negative / trade-offs: **there is no "roll out to everyone".** A fleet-wide delivery needs every
  Agent to carry the same channel value, and a fresh host belongs to no Deployment until labelled or
  provisioned with one — a discipline for provisioning.
- Negative / trade-offs: two builds of one Agent type at one version cannot coexist; they must differ
  in type or version. The same Package in two Deployments is signed in each, although the signature
  over the same bytes with the same key is identical. An operator who set `[self_update] package` to
  something other than an Agent type sees that Client refuse the offer on its fleet row.
- Negative / trade-offs: nothing reaches an Agent before it is signed — a trial rollout needs the
  signing key too, and a Platform entry uploaded after a rollout reaches no Agent until the
  Deployment signs it.
- Positive (Strategy *Security before convenience*): a compromised host gets from the store only
  what its own Agents were released. What was released to another host's Agents
  stays with them, within the limit the Negative entry on partitions names. An unreleased build cannot be fetched by anyone, and the store's contents
  cannot be listed by probing.
- Positive (G-10): the offer and the download share one test, so a Client that was offered an
  artifact can always fetch it. The offer tests type fit as well
  (clause 9).
- Positive (Q-1): no setting turns the bound off. It holds whatever the configuration is.
- Negative / trade-offs: a certificate that names no host fetches nothing. Two cases are affected:
  a fleet whose Server signs no CSRs (no `[client_ca]`) and whose operator provisions
  certificates without the host SAN URI, and a third-party Agent with such a certificate. Each
  gets `404` instead of bytes. The startup notice (clause 37) and the audit entry say why.
  The manual (`docs/manual/server.md`, `[client_ca]` and the download route) states that without
  `[client_ca]` a hand-provisioned certificate must carry `urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>` to receive
  uploaded artifacts.
- Negative / trade-offs: a partition is only as strong as the hosts it partitions (Context). A
  compromised host can report another partition's attributes under a fresh `instance_uid`, be
  assigned by that partition's next bulk rollout, and then fetch what was released. Today a
  partition set by a Server label is not stronger, because a reported attribute satisfies the same
  Selector. Making labels authoritative for a partition would close this: a Selector term that
  only a label can satisfy, or a reported key that is refused when it shadows a label key. That
  is a follow-up. The fleet view shows such an Agent as waiting before the press that assigns it.
- Negative / trade-offs: one lookup under the fleet lock per download. For an ordinary host this
  is a lookup per bound `instance_uid` (at most 256). For a Gateway it is a scan of the fleet's
  records, because it speaks for any Agent. The rate limit of clause 40 bounds how often that scan runs. An index from artifact to offering
  Agents is an option if the scan shows up.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Gateway's certificate stays as broad as its mark already makes it.
  This decision makes that explicit and does not narrow it.
- Negative / trade-offs: an Agent that reports a different `service.name` after it was rolled out
  to is no longer offered the old type's Package. That follows from
  clause 9.
- Positive (G-10, G-15): a Client behind a Gateway receives uploaded artifacts, through the
  Gateway, from a Server that keeps clause 37 unchanged. Each artifact crosses the Gateway's
  upstream link once per Gateway instead of once per Agent, and costs the Server one download.
- Positive (Strategy *Security before convenience*): a host behind a Gateway receives from it only
  what the Server offered through it to that host's own Agents. The Gateway's breadth under
  clause 37 is not passed on, and a downstream host cannot list what the Gateway holds.
- Positive: a nested Gateway is served by the Gateway in front of it like any downstream host: the
  Agents it carries are routed over its connection, which presents its certificate.
- Negative / trade-offs: the Gateway now holds artifacts on disk, up to `package_cache_bytes`
  (10 GiB by default), staged fetches included. Its `state_dir` needs that space.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Gateway that restarts holds no offers. An Agent whose install is still
  in flight reconnects, and its report re-draws the offer, since the Server re-sends an offer
  whose hash the Agent has not echoed. An Agent that echoed the offer with a failed install and
  then retries is answered `404` until the Server sends it a different offer. Pressing the same
  version again yields the same hash, which the hash gate does not re-send; a rollout of another
  version does.
- Negative / trade-offs: a host behind a Gateway holds at most `max_carried_agents` bindings, so a
  host carrying more Agents through one Gateway than that cannot have the rest served from the
  cache. At the global cap a flood from many hosts can push out bindings that have neither a route
  nor an offer; such an Agent is bound again by its next report.
- Negative / trade-offs: an `instance_uid` is bound to the host of the first report for it after
  the Gateway starts. Until that first report a host that reports another host's `instance_uid`
  first is bound instead and served its offers; the real host's peer is answered `404`, and the
  Gateway logs each offer it does not record. The remedy for such a lockout is a restart of the
  Gateway, after which the real host's next report binds it. Within one Gateway this is the bound
  the Server's host register gives directly connected hosts
  ([ADR-0022](0022-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md) clause 7).
- Negative / trade-offs: a fetch that failed is not tried again until the artifact newly appears in
  an Agent's offer, so a transient error upstream can leave the Agents behind the Gateway without
  it until the next rollout. A `429` or `503` with `Retry-After` is not such a failure.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Client now waits up to 30 minutes, in waits of at most 60 seconds, on a
  `429` or `503` from its own Server origin before it reports a download failed (clause 49). A
  failure the Server or Gateway answers that way is reported that much later.
- Negative / trade-offs: an artifact larger than the cache is not delivered behind the Gateway at
  all; the Gateway's log names it, and the downstream Agent reports the failed download.
- Negative / trade-offs: with `advertised_url` set, uploaded artifacts are not delivered behind a
  Gateway at all (clause 43). A fleet with Gateways leaves `advertised_url` unset.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Gateway whose host is not marked delivers no uploaded artifact; its log says that the Server refused the fetch.
- Positive: an upstream release, archive and all, is deliverable as published; the SHA-256 from
  its `checksums.txt` and the operator's signature are checked on every host, and a confidential
  agent stays encrypted everywhere but the host that runs it.
- Positive: nothing reaches a host that the operator's key did not sign, whatever the Server or an
  offer claims, and no archive parser sees bytes that have not passed both checks.
- Positive: an offered header and the Client's certificate go only where the operator allowed —
  the certificate to the Server alone — so a mirror's redirect cannot harvest either.
- Positive: an agent that is an executable plus its libraries is managed like any other — the
  health gate, rollback, retention and version report come with it.
- Positive: neither failure loop can start. A first package that will not run stays installed and
  `InstallFailed`; a pair of broken versions is reported and held; for a day after a successful
  update the previous version is still on disk.
- Negative / trade-offs: every fleet must create and keep a signing key, and put its public half
  on every host, before it can distribute anything; a fleet that has not is told so at startup and
  takes no packages.
- Negative / trade-offs: the allow-list is configuration on every host, and a release host that
  redirects to a storage or CDN origin needs that origin listed too, or the download fails at the
  hop.
- Negative / trade-offs: every host parses untrusted archives. Path sanitizing, link refusal and
  the size and member bounds are the tested boundary, because a tree archive does choose where
  its bytes land.
- Negative / trade-offs: disk — two copies of a program or tree per Supervisor during the
  retention window, and the artifact ceiling and unpack bound sized for agents of hundreds of
  megabytes.
- Negative / trade-offs: the archive key is a fleet-wide secret in `supervisor.toml` on every
  host, protected only by the file's permissions; rotating it means every host and every encrypted
  archive.
- Negative / trade-offs: a `.7z` or `.zip` tree carries no helper executables' modes, and a sloppy
  `.tar.gz` produces an agent that does not start — a cause in the archive, not on the host.
- Negative / trade-offs: two on-disk layouts, chosen by whether one optional key is set.
- Follow-ups: a retention policy for superseded packages; warning when a type or Platform fits no
  Agent in the fleet; verifying upstream sigstore provenance instead of a pasted checksum;
  `host.name` and `cloud.*` reporting; whether a Configuration should be aimed by the Deployment
  that already aims its Agent's Package; inequality in Selectors; refusing an overlapping Selector
  at write time once a fleet is large enough that a conflict is expensive to notice; a Selector
  term that only a Server label satisfies, so that a partition can hold against the host it
  partitions; sourcing the archive key from an OS keystore or a tighter file; distributing keys
  without letting the Server read artifacts; rotating the verification key across a fleet; scoping
  an offered header to a path; a directory mode for the packing tool; range-request resumption for
  large artifacts. `SECURITY.md` (the trust-boundary section) and the manual's download-route rows
  in `docs/manual/server.md` state the bound, and `docs/manual/client.md` the Gateway's cache.

    (clauses 42, 45).

- `crates/fleet-agent/tests/gateway_package_cache.rs`, against the real Server on mutual TLS:
  - `a_client_behind_a_marked_gateway_receives_an_uploaded_artifact_through_it` — the Gateway
    fetches with its own certificate what the Server offers an Agent behind it, and the downstream
    Client's own download code (`download_and_verify`) fetches it from the Gateway and verifies its
    hash and signature (clauses 37, 42, 44, 45).

**Not mechanically decidable:** that the Server never opens an artifact (clause 6) is an absence —
no test can show a code path that does not exist; review of every change touching
`crates/fleet-server/src/packages.rs` and `crates/fleet-server/src/api.rs` keeps it. That the probe
speaks TLS 1.3 alone (clause 5) is a client setting no test can observe: a refused handshake counts
as an unreachable source, which is stored like an answering one, so review keeps it. That every
download on the Agent is TLS 1.3 and that the client certificate reaches only the Server's own
origin are settled by construction in `download_and_verify` — two download clients built on the
Client's TLS settings, the identified one used only for that origin — and no test stands up a TLS
source that inspects the handshake, so review of every change to
[`packages.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/src/packages.rs) keeps them. That the Client names the
missing key at startup is a log line in
[`service/runtime.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/src/service/runtime.rs) that no test reads.
