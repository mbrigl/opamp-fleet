# ADR-NNNN: <short title of the decision>

- **Status:** 🟡 proposed
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders:** <names / roles of the humans who decide>
- **Applies to:** <the paths, components, or kinds of change this decision constrains>
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-NNNN](NNNN-short-title.md)

*Complete the header and delete what does not apply. `Status` ships as `🟡 proposed`; a human flips
it to `🟢 accepted`, `🔴 rejected`, or `⚪ superseded by ADR-NNNN`, keeping exactly one emoji with
the word that belongs to it. `Date` is the date of the last status change: the date the ADR was
proposed until the first flip. Revising a `proposed` ADR does not move it and needs no note; git
carries the history. `Deciders` names the humans who accept or reject; an agent is never a
decider. `Applies to` names what the decision constrains, concrete paths where it has them,
otherwise the kind of change (every commit, every public interface), in one line without a pipe
character: the index mirrors it verbatim, and that is how a reader finds the ADRs that bind a
change ([mechanics](README.md#mechanics)). `Supersedes` only when this ADR replaces one existing
ADR or several whose decisions have grown into one, each linked; their status lines flip in the
same pull request ([mechanics](README.md#mechanics)). For a decision recorded only because a
reader would take it for a mistake, cheap to reverse and constraining nothing
([`AGENTS.md` §3](../../AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules), rule 2), a sentence each under Context and Decision
and `None — cheap to reverse` under Alternatives, Sources, and Consequences is the whole record;
Enforcement stays. Then delete this paragraph.*

## Context

What is the issue, and which forces are at play: requirements from
[`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](../SPECIFICATION.md), constraints from other ADRs, technical forces?

Interrogate the request with the human before writing this section
([`AGENTS.md` §3](../../AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules), rule 3); the `propose-adr` skill under
[`.agents/skills/`](../../.agents/skills/) lists the questions.

## Decision

What we decided, in one clear, active sentence ("We will …"). A second "We will …" sentence is a
sign of two ADRs ([`AGENTS.md` §3](../../AGENTS.md#3-adr-rules)).

**Out of scope:** what this decision deliberately leaves open, so a later ADR can take it up
without contradicting this one. Write "nothing beyond the sentence above" when the decision is
already narrow.

## Alternatives considered

- **<Alternative A>** — why it was not chosen.
- **<Alternative B>** — why it was not chosen.

## Sources / Prior art

State of the art and established solutions consulted before deciding: links, docs, papers,
comparable systems. [`AGENTS.md` §4](../../AGENTS.md#4-working-style) requires citing what
informed the decision. Write "None — trivial/reversible" only when that is genuinely true.

## Consequences

- Positive: what becomes easier or possible.
- Negative / trade-offs: what becomes harder, what we accept.
- Follow-ups: the questions this decision raises, described by topic, never by an ADR number that
  does not exist yet.

## Enforcement

What keeps this decision true and where it lives: the check, test, CI job, or review step that
fails when it is violated. Name the test that cites this ADR, or write a paragraph starting
`**Not mechanically decidable:**` with the reason no test can decide it.
Accepting an ADR that has neither fails CI ([ADR-0003](0003-decisions-verified-by-tests.md)).
