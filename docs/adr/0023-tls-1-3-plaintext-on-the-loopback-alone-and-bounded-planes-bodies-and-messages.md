# ADR-0023: Both OpAMP transports on both ends over TLS 1.3 alone, plaintext on the loopback alone, a Server on two listeners split by audience with bounded connections, bodies and messages, and admitted Agents rate-limited per host

- **Status:** 🟢 accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** the OpAMP endpoint and both transports in `crates/fleet-server/src/transport.rs` and `crates/fleet-agent/src/transport/`, TLS in `crates/opamp/src/tls.rs`, `crates/fleet-server/src/tls.rs` and `crates/fleet-agent/src/tls.rs`, the plaintext rule in `crates/opamp/src/client/connection.rs`, how every listener binds and serves and how it reads a request body or a WebSocket message in `crates/opamp/src/server/`, the package upload in `crates/fleet-server/src/api.rs`, `crates/fleet-server/src/listen.rs` and `main.rs`, the package URL probe in `crates/fleet-server/src/api.rs`, the `rustls` features in `Cargo.toml`, the `listen`, `max_connections`, `[rest]` and `[tls]` keys of `server.toml`, the message limit in `crates/fleet-server/src/agent_rate.rs`, `on_message` and `on_unreadable` of the Server's handler, the enrolment refusals in `Fleet::enrol` and the download guard `admit_download` in `crates/fleet-server/src/transport.rs`, every `Unavailable` reply in `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs`, the `[agent_rate_limit]` section of `server.toml` and its parsing and startup warning in `crates/fleet-server/src/config.rs`, and the `agent_rate.throttled` audit event

## Context

The Baseline defines two transports: *"Server implementations SHOULD accept both plain HTTP
connections and WebSocket connections. OpAMP Client implementations may choose to support
either."* The specification's strategy — implement the protocol as completely as it allows — turns
that into an obligation on both ends: a Server accepting one transport locks out half the
third-party clients, and a Client speaking one cannot exercise both faces of its own Server.

- **Plain HTTP** — the Client POSTs a protobuf `AgentToServer` with
  `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf` and receives a `ServerToAgent`; it polls (default
  30 seconds). The Server MUST honour `Content-Encoding: gzip`. Server-initiated messages wait for
  the next poll.
- **WebSocket** — one persistent connection, either side sends at will, each message a varint
  header plus the protobuf body. It is the transport that gives the control loop its "within
  seconds" property and the one Gateway multiplexing is stated for
  ([ADR-0034](0034-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)).
- **Detection** — one path (`/v1/opamp`, default port 4320); the Baseline itself describes the
  `Content-Type` header as how the Server tells the two apart.

TLS is part of the transport: goal 17 of the [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md) requires
Client–Server traffic to be TLS-protected. The Strategy narrows that: every connection that leaves
the host is TLS 1.3, and plaintext is accepted on the loopback alone. Q-1 adds that a configuration
breaking this is refused at startup, naming the setting, never warned. The Dev Container
([ADR-0002](0002-dev-container-runtime.md)) has neither OpenSSL headers nor cmake, which
`aws-lc-rs`-backed rustls needs.

In this ADR, **LOOPBACK** means the IP literals `127.0.0.1` and `::1`. A host name is never
LOOPBACK, `localhost` included: what it resolves to is a resolver's answer, not the
configuration's.

The Server has two audiences with nothing in common but the process. Agents connect from the whole
estate, hold long-lived WebSocket sessions, speak protobuf, and prove fleet membership
([ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)). Operators and portals connect from a few
places, speak JSON over short requests, and act with authority over every Agent — reading the
fleet, rewriting Configurations, uploading and rolling out packages. One address for both means one
exposure, one TLS policy, and one answer to "who may connect" for two questions with different
answers; it also forces client-certificate checks into route code, since a browser presents none.

One route crosses that line: the package download. Its path is under `/api/v1`, but its audience is
Agents. The `download_url` in a package offer is by default a path the Client resolves against its
own OpAMP endpoint, host and port ([ADR-0018](0018-signed-package-delivery-from-allowed-sources.md)). The
downloading Client presents no credential. It reaches the route through the Agent plane's TLS
handshake, so it presents its client certificate there as it does for `/v1/opamp`. The content
hash and signature protect the artifact.

Finally, a connection is bounded by message size limits, Admission, and on TLS listeners a
handshake deadline — but nothing bounds the time before a request exists. A peer can open a
connection, send `GET /v1/opamp HTTP/1.1\r\n` and fall silent, costing the Server a task and
hyper's read buffer per connection, before any route or credential check runs. hyper 1.x defaults
`header_read_timeout` to 30 s, but the default is inert unless a `Timer` is installed (its
`Time::check` warns and resolves to `None`), and configuring the timeout without a timer panics.
Neither `axum::serve` (0.8) nor `axum_server` (0.7) installs one; `axum::serve` exposes no builder
at all, while `axum_server::Server::http_builder()` does. A per-request timeout is the wrong
instrument: the three routes that matter — the WebSocket, the download, the package upload with
its body limit off — are meant to take long, and middleware runs only after the headers are parsed.

Two more bounds are missing. Nothing limits how many connections a peer may hold open at once, and
`max_agents` bounds the fleet, not the sockets. The TLS listeners offer `h2` by ALPN, and the
header-read timeout is HTTP/1 only; an HTTP/2 peer is bounded by the message size and by nothing
else. [`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md) names these H16 and H17.

Once the headers are in, nothing bounds the body either. A peer can send the headers of a `POST`
and then nothing, or a byte a minute, and hold the connection and its task for as long as it
likes: on the Agent plane, which faces the estate, up to `max_message_size_bytes`; on the Operator
plane up to axum's 2 MiB JSON limit, or `max_package_size_bytes` on the upload; on the Gateway
endpoint and the Supervisor Endpoint the same as the Agent plane. A WebSocket message can be
trickled the same way, frame by frame, before it is ever handed to the handler. The connection cap
bounds how many such peers there are, not how long each one stays. A deadline is still the wrong
instrument — a large upload over a slow link and a long-lived session are both legitimate — but a
floor on the pace is not: a body that has started arriving must keep arriving.

Admission on the Agent plane ends at the handshake
([ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)). From there on, nothing above bounds
how many messages an admitted peer sends:

- the connection cap (clause 16) bounds sockets;
- the message size limit (clause 3) bounds each message;
- the pace floor (clause 14) bounds how slowly a message may arrive;
- the throttle of ADR-0026 clause 24 counts failed admissions per peer address, and a member never
  fails.

None of them bounds how often. One WebSocket session can send a full report as fast as the Server
decodes it. Each report takes the fleet lock, may write the Agent's record to disk
([ADR-0013](0013-the-fleet-record.md)), may compose an offer, and may ask for a certificate to be
signed. A plain-HTTP poller can do the same with one request per message. The package download
route is the Agent plane's other member route, and it costs more: under
[ADR-0033](0033-a-host-fetches-only-what-its-agents-are-offered-and-a-gateway-caches-it-for-the-hosts-behind-it.md), each request scans
the fleet under its lock to find an Agent the artifact is offered to.

The specification holds that no vulnerability can be ruled out (Strategy *Security before
convenience*). A host taken over, or a Client with a bug that loops, is still a member, and
without a bound it can take the Server's time from every other Agent. Q-2 asks that untrusted
input be bounded, and an admitted peer's message is still input from the network.

Forces that shape the rate limit:

- **The host is the unit admission knows.** A certificate names the host it was issued to as
  `urn:opamp-fleet:host:<id>` (ADR-0026 clause 7). `instance_uid` is self-asserted (ADR-0026
  clause 14), so a limit keyed on it alone binds nothing: a peer chooses a new uid for each
  message. A certificate an operator provisioned outside the CSR flow names no host until it is
  first renewed. It is still one certificate, told apart by its issuer and serial (`CertId` in
  [`revocation.rs`](../../crates/fleet-server/src/revocation.rs)).
- **A Gateway carries other hosts' Agents.** Behind a marked Gateway every Agent arrives under the
  Gateway's certificate (ADR-0026 clause 13,
  [ADR-0034](0034-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)
  clause 11). A per-host limit there would put a whole site under one host's budget. A per-uid
  limit alone bounds nothing, because a downstream peer can cycle uids. The Gateway's
  `max_carried_agents` does not stop that either: it bounds one downstream connection, and a
  plain-HTTP downstream exchange is a connection of its own
  ([`gateway/mod.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/src/gateway/mod.rs) creates a `Downstream` per
  exchange).
- **The protocol has one retryable refusal.** `ServerErrorResponseType` has three types. Only
  `UNAVAILABLE` tells the Agent to retry, and `RetryInfo.retry_after_nanoseconds` says when.
  - On a WebSocket, the Baseline's *Throttling* section says a Server that cannot process an
    `AgentToServer` message *"SHOULD respond with an ServerToAgent message"* whose `error_response`
    type is `UNAVAILABLE`, and that *"The Client SHOULD disconnect, wait, then reconnect again"*.
  - On plain HTTP the Server *"MAY return HTTP 503 … or HTTP 429"* with `Retry-After`, a header
    that *"SHOULD be used only for the client's attempts to reconnect"*.
  - *"The minimum recommended retry interval is 30 seconds."*
  - This Server answers `Unavailable` with `retry_info` of 30 s (`RETRY_AFTER` in
    [`fleet.rs`](../../crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs)) in four places besides the rate limit: at
    the Agent-record ceiling, when the enrolment queue is full, when no enrolment window is open
    (ADR-0026 clause 21), and when the audit record holds back a CSR
    ([ADR-0030](0030-an-append-only-audit-record-chained-by-hash.md) clause 6).
- **The Client honours `Unavailable` on both transports.**
  [`opamp::client::protocol`](../../crates/opamp/src/client/protocol.rs) turns it into a wait,
  `retry_info` or 30 s without one.
  - On a WebSocket the Client closes the connection, waits, and reconnects with a full report from
    every Agent it carries ([`ws.rs`](../../crates/opamp/src/client/ws.rs)).
  - On plain HTTP it waits and resumes its routine reports
    ([`http.rs`](../../crates/opamp/src/client/http.rs)).
- **A refused message loses nothing.** The Server detects a gap in `sequence_num` and answers the
  next message it processes with `ReportFullState` (`fleet.rs`). The Baseline's *Retrying
  Messages* section lets a Client keep one up-to-date message of each kind rather than a queue.
- **A reply reaches an Agent only when it carries that Agent's `instance_uid`.** This project's
  own Client routes every reply by that field and drops one without it, on every connection
  (`Engine::handle` in [`engine.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/src/engine.rs)). A Gateway drops one
  too (ADR-0034 clause 13, [`pool.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/src/gateway/pool.rs)). An
  `Unavailable` reply built without an `instance_uid` reaches no Agent, and the Client never waits
  as told.
- **A host speaks for at most 256 Agents** (ADR-0026 clause 7), and after a reconnect the Client
  sends one full report for each of them. At the Baseline's 30 s heartbeat or poll, 256 Agents
  send about 8.5 messages a second.
- **Refusals already have a bounded record.** ADR-0030 clause 5 writes at most ten refusals of one
  event per peer address and second, and counts the rest. ADR-0030 clause 6 counts every decision
  whose entry could not be queued in the next entry's `unrecorded_before`.

## Decision

We will implement both OpAMP transports on both ends over rustls with the `ring` provider and TLS
1.3 alone, accept plaintext only on LOOPBACK, and serve the Server on two listeners split by
audience — an Agent plane that always serves TLS and a loopback-default Operator plane — each built
in one place that bounds connection setup, the number of connections, HTTP/2, and the pace of every
request body and WebSocket message, and limit what an admitted peer sends on the Agent plane with a
token bucket per host, per Agent within an aggregate bucket for a host marked as a Gateway.

1. **One endpoint, both transports, detected per request.** The Server serves `/v1/opamp` on its
   Agent plane: a WebSocket upgrade (`GET`) starts the WebSocket transport, a `POST` carrying
   `Content-Type: application/x-protobuf` is one plain-HTTP exchange, and a `POST` without that
   type is answered `415`. Both hand every decoded report to the same processing, so transport is
   carriage, never semantics.

2. **The Client selects the transport by its endpoint's scheme.** `ws://`/`wss://` is WebSocket,
   `http://`/`https://` is polling; any other scheme fails at startup. `ws://` and `http://` are
   accepted only when the endpoint's host is LOOPBACK; any other host fails at startup with a
   message naming the endpoint. The default endpoint is `wss://127.0.0.1:4320/v1/opamp`, so
   WebSocket over TLS is the default — it is the only transport that delivers Server-initiated
   changes without polling latency. `poll_interval_secs` (default 30) governs polling;
   `heartbeat_interval_secs` (default 30, `0` disables heartbeats and undeclares
   `ReportsHeartbeat`) governs WebSocket. A Server-offered heartbeat replaces both
   ([ADR-0027](0027-connection-settings-offered-without-a-credential-and-server-capabilities.md)).

3. **Gzip and a message size limit on both transports.** The Server accepts gzip request bodies
   (a Baseline MUST) and enforces `max_message_size_bytes` (default 64 MiB, `0` refused at startup)
   in both directions and on both transports, applied after decompression: `413` on plain HTTP, a
   `1009` close on WebSocket, and an oversized reply is discarded rather than sent. The shared
   helpers that implement this live in `crates/opamp`
   ([ADR-0025](0025-five-crates-a-publishable-communication-layer-and-toml-configuration-axum-without-its-websocket.md)).

4. **Reconnection belongs to the Client's transport layer.** A lost connection is retried with
   exponential backoff from one second, capped at one minute, with jitter (the Baseline asks for
   jitter so a restarted Server is not hit by the whole fleet on the same instants); after a
   reconnect the Client sends a full status report. The Server keys no state on the connection
   ([ADR-0034](0034-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)).

5. **TLS is TLS 1.3 alone, on rustls with the `ring` provider, everywhere; no OpenSSL, no system
   TLS library.** `reqwest` requires the `tls12` feature of `rustls`, so the floor is held where
   every configuration is built rather than by the build. `opamp::tls::provider()` is the
   `ring` provider with the three TLS 1.3 suites and nothing else: `TLS13_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,
   `TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `TLS13_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`. Every rustls configuration of
   both ends is built from it with the protocol versions pinned to TLS 1.3
   ([ADR-0024](0024-the-whole-opamp-communication-layer-in-the-opamp-crate-reading-websocket-frames-itself.md)). Each binary
   installs it process-wide at startup, and every `reqwest` client is built with a minimum of TLS
   1.3. This covers every connection: OpAMP, the REST API, downloads, mirrors, own telemetry and
   the Server's outbound probe. Without `[tls] ca_file` a Client trusts the built-in webpki roots on
   `wss://` and the platform's trust store on `https://`, the default `reqwest` takes; with it,
   that bundle replaces both. `axum-server` (`tls-rustls-no-provider`) terminates TLS on the
   Server, `tokio-tungstenite` (`rustls-tls-webpki-roots`) carries `wss://`, and `reqwest`
   (`rustls-no-provider`, `gzip`) carries `https://`. The `*-no-provider` features keep `aws-lc-rs`
   out of the build, so a missing provider is an error, never a silent fallback.
   On the Client, `[tls] ca_file` replaces the built-in webpki roots, so self-signed deployments
   work; trust is the operator's file, never a Server's instruction.

6. **Two listeners, split by audience rather than by path.**

   | Plane | Key | Default | TLS | Serves |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Agent | `listen` | `127.0.0.1:4320` | always | `/v1/opamp`, the package download route, and the Gateways' revocation list ([ADR-0031](0031-certificate-revocation-that-follows-renewal-and-reaches-the-gateways.md) clause 12) |
   | Operator | `[rest] listen` | `127.0.0.1:4321` | always | `/api/v1/…`, `/api/v1/openapi.json`, `/api/v1/docs` with its vendored Redoc bundle, and the bundled UI at `/` |

   The Agent plane listens on LOOPBACK by default. Serving the estate is one deliberate line in
   `server.toml`, together with the TLS material it needs. `[rest]` is a table so that the plane's
   own settings (its authentication, [ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md), and its
   connection cap) live inside it; unknown keys are refused as everywhere
   ([ADR-0025](0025-five-crates-a-publishable-communication-layer-and-toml-configuration-axum-without-its-websocket.md)). The router is split accordingly:
   `server::agent_app(state, admission)` and `server::operator_app(state, auth)`.

7. **The Operator plane is loopback by default.** Its reachability is its first protection; a
   network-open default would export the fleet's full control surface. Reaching it from elsewhere
   is one deliberate line in `server.toml`, or an SSH tunnel. It serves TLS with the material of
   clause 9 on every address. Off LOOPBACK it requires authentication as the admission decision
   states; a Server lacking it is refused at startup.

8. **The package download stays on the Agent plane, outside the credential check, under its
   `/api/v1` path.** The offered `download_url` therefore remains a path the Client resolves
   against its own endpoint, and `advertised_url` stays an option for mirrors and other hosts,
   never an obligation. The download is reached through the same TLS handshake as `/v1/opamp`, so
   the Client presents its client certificate to its own Server's origin and to no other host.
   What the handshake requires of that certificate is the admission decision's
   ([ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)). The route is
   served on that one listener only — the Operator plane answers it `404` — and the OpenAPI
   document, generated from the Operator plane's routes, does not carry it; the manual documents it
   as the Agent plane's.

9. **One set of TLS material for both listeners, and it is required.** `[tls] cert_file`/`key_file`
   serve both planes, each with ALPN `h2` and
   `http/1.1`. A Server without `[tls]` is refused at startup with a message naming the section.
   `[tls] client_ca_file` applies to the Agent plane alone, and what it requires is
   [ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)'s. There are no
   per-listener certificates.

10. **Two listeners always; addresses that cannot both be bound fail at startup.** There is no
    single-port mode. The same port on the same address, or on an address that covers every
    interface (`0.0.0.0:4320` and `127.0.0.1:4320`), is refused at load with a message naming both
    keys. Both listeners are bound before either serves, and a bind failure names the plane.

11. **Every plane's server is built in one place, with an HTTP/1 header-read timeout of 30
    seconds.** `listen::plane` serves both planes on `opamp::server::listen`
    ([ADR-0024](0024-the-whole-opamp-communication-layer-in-the-opamp-crate-reading-websocket-frames-itself.md)), which serves plain
    and TLS through `axum_server`, installs `hyper_util::rt::TokioTimer` on the HTTP/1 builder, and
    sets `header_read_timeout` to `HEADER_READ_TIMEOUT` (30 s — hyper's own default, and what axum
    applies once it installs the timer itself). The timeout is a parameter of the serving function
    so a test can drive it short. `hyper-util` is a dependency of `opamp`'s `server` feature for
    this.

12. **The TLS handshake deadline is stated, not inherited.** `TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT` is 10 seconds
    on both planes' acceptors — `axum_server`'s default value, named in this code so it reads as a
    decision.

13. **Shutdown is one bounded drain for both planes.** One `axum_server::Handle` is shared by both
    listeners; an interrupt calls `graceful_shutdown` with `SHUTDOWN_DRAIN` (10 s), whatever has not
    ended by then is cut, and the Agent-record flush of
    [ADR-0013](0013-the-fleet-record.md) runs afterwards.

14. **No request timeout, but a floor on the pace of every body and every message; no
    `tower-http`, no `server.toml` key for these bounds.** The long routes stay long: nothing has a
    deadline, and a connection with nothing in flight — an idle WebSocket session between messages,
    a keep-alive connection between requests — is not bounded by this clause. A request body
    begins when its headers end, and a WebSocket message with its first byte; from then on it must
    deliver at least `MIN_PACE_BYTES` (64 KiB) within every `PACE_WINDOW` (60 s), each window
    measured from the end of the one before, or have ended. A body announced in the headers but
    never sent is therefore bounded as one that stops. A body that falls behind is answered `408` and whatever was staged
    from it is removed; a WebSocket message that falls behind closes its connection with `1008`.
    The floor holds on every listener `opamp`'s server serves — the Agent plane, the Operator
    plane, the Gateway endpoint and the Supervisor Endpoint — for every route, the package upload
    included, and on both HTTP versions. The two values are named constants, the same everywhere: a
    knob is added when a deployment needs a value other than these, not before.

15. **Plaintext on LOOPBACK alone, refused at startup elsewhere.** A listener without TLS is
    accepted only on a LOOPBACK address. `opamp`'s `Listener::serve` refuses a plaintext listener
    on any other address, and `opamp::client::connection` refuses `ws://` or `http://` to any other
    host. Each end refuses such a configuration at startup with a message naming the setting; it
    never warns and continues.

16. **A connection cap per plane.** `max_connections` caps the Agent plane (default 10 000) and
    `[rest] max_connections` the Operator plane (default 256); `0` is refused at startup. The cap
    is applied in the accept loop of `opamp`'s listener. A connection past the cap is closed on
    accept, before the TLS handshake, while the connections already established keep working. A
    fleet larger than the default raises the key together with the process's file-descriptor
    limit.

17. **HTTP/2 is bounded on every listener.** `opamp`'s listener sets the HTTP/2 builder of every
    listener it serves, so every TLS listener, where ALPN offers `h2`, carries the bounds.
    `H2_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` is 100 per connection. A keep-alive ping is sent every
    `H2_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL` (30 s), and a peer that leaves one unanswered for
    `H2_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` (20 s) is dropped. They are named constants, not keys, as clause 14
    states for the HTTP/1 bound.

18. **The Server's outbound HTTP is TLS 1.3 and `https://`.** The probe that asks a package source
    whether it holds an artifact speaks `https://` over the provider of clause 5. An `http://`
    source is probed only on LOOPBACK; off LOOPBACK it is refused with a message naming the URL.
    The probe keeps its refusal of internal addresses and redirects.

19. **`[agent_rate_limit]` in `server.toml`.** The rate limit covers an admitted peer's
    `AgentToServer` messages on `/v1/opamp` over both transports and its requests on the package
    download route. The section is optional, and its defaults are in force when it is absent. Any
    other key is refused, as in every section. No value switches the limit off.

    | Key | Default | Rule |
    |---|---|---|
    | `messages_per_sec` | `10` | Tokens added to a host's or an Agent's bucket per second, continuously. `0` is refused at startup with a message naming the key. |
    | `burst` | `300` | That bucket's capacity, enough for one full report from each of the 256 Agents a host may speak for (ADR-0026 clause 7) after a reconnect. A new bucket starts full. `0` is refused at startup with a message naming the key. |
    | `gateway_messages_per_sec` | `500` | Tokens added per second to the aggregate bucket of a host marked as a Gateway. `0` is refused at startup with a message naming the key. |
    | `gateway_burst` | `10000` | The aggregate bucket's capacity: one full report from each Agent at the default `max_carried_agents` (ADR-0034 clause 4). `0` is refused at startup with a message naming the key. |

20. **The Server warns when the limit is below what the fleet's heartbeat needs.**
    `messages_per_sec` times the offered `[connection_offer] heartbeat_interval_secs` is the number
    of Agents one host can report for at that interval. Without an offer, the Baseline's 30 s is
    used. When that product is below 256, the Server logs a warning at startup naming both keys.
    It is a warning, not a refusal: a limit set too low costs availability, not security. At the
    defaults the product is 300.

21. **What is counted.** Each of the following costs one token, on every connection that passed
    admission:
    - every message the endpoint hands to the Server's handler on `/v1/opamp`, on both transports.
      That covers a member's connection and an enrolment connection, a plain-HTTP request (one
      message each), and every message on a WebSocket session;
    - a message that cannot be decoded (`on_unreadable`);
    - every request on the package download route that admission let through.

    On `/v1/opamp` the check runs first in `on_message`: before enrolment, before a CSR is read, and
    before `process_presented` takes the fleet lock. On the download route it runs in
    `admit_download` once the certificate is admitted, before the route's handler.

    Not counted: a WebSocket upgrade that sends nothing, which the connection cap bounds, and the
    Gateways' revocation list.

22. **Which bucket a message or a download is counted in.** The key comes from the certificate
    admission proved (`Proofs` in [`transport.rs`](../../crates/fleet-server/src/transport.rs)):
    - **A certificate that names a host:** that host.
    - **A member's certificate that names no host** (one an operator provisioned that has not been
      renewed yet): its issuer and serial.
    - **A bootstrap certificate on an enrolment connection:** the peer address, an IPv6 one by its
      /64 (`throttle::peer_key`). A bootstrap certificate may be one for the whole fleet (ADR-0026
      clause 10), so its issuer and serial would put every enrolling host in one bucket. The
      enrolment window, the bound on the queue and the operator's approval already bound what
      enrolment costs (ADR-0026 clauses 20, 21).
    - **A host marked as a Gateway** (`Revocations::is_gateway`), in two buckets, and a message must
      take a token from both:
      - the bucket of the Agent the message names, keyed by the host and the message's
        `instance_uid` and sized by `messages_per_sec` and `burst`;
      - the Gateway's aggregate, keyed by the host and sized by `gateway_messages_per_sec` and
        `gateway_burst`.

      A message whose `instance_uid` is not 16 bytes, an undecodable message, and a download
      request through a Gateway name no Agent, so they are counted in the aggregate alone. The mark
      is read per message, so marking or unmarking a Gateway takes effect at the next message.

    A connection with no certificate exists only behind `Admission::open`, which no Server
    configuration serves (ADR-0026 clause 6). It is counted by its peer address.

23. **What a message past the limit gets.** A message that finds no whole token in a bucket it must
    pass is not processed. No record is created or updated, `last_seen_ms` does not move, no CSR is
    read, and nothing is offered. Its reply is a `ServerToAgent` with:
    - the message's own `instance_uid` (clause 25);
    - the Server's capabilities;
    - `error_response` of type `Unavailable`, with an `error_message` saying that too many messages
      arrive;
    - `retry_info.retry_after_nanoseconds` of 30 s, the `RETRY_AFTER` every other `Unavailable` of
      this Server carries and the Baseline's minimum recommended retry interval.

    On plain HTTP the reply is the protobuf body of a `200`, never a `429` or a `503`. The Baseline
    gives `Retry-After` to reconnect attempts, and this keeps the OpAMP answer apart from the
    failed-admission throttle of ADR-0026 clause 24.

    The Server does not close the connection. A WebSocket Client that honours the Baseline closes it
    itself and comes back after 30 s; messages that arrive before it does are counted and answered
    the same way. A throttled message leaves `sequence_num` where it was, so the next message the
    Server processes from that Agent is answered with `ReportFullState`.

24. **What a download past the limit gets.** The download route is plain HTTP and not OpAMP, so it
    has no `ServerErrorResponse`. A request past the limit is answered `429` with `Retry-After: 30`,
    and the artifact is not read. This `429` differs from the one ADR-0026 clause 24 sends:

    | | ADR-0026 clause 24 | This clause |
    |---|---|---|
    | When it is sent | Before the certificate is judged | After the certificate is admitted |
    | Who gets it | A peer address in back-off for failed admissions | A member over its rate |
    | `Retry-After` | The seconds of back-off left | 30 |
    | Feeds the failure count | — | No, it is no failure |
    | Recorded as | `download.throttled` | `agent_rate.throttled` with `route` `download` (clause 27) |

    The Client's downloader treats either one as a failed download.

25. **Every `Unavailable` reply carries the `instance_uid` of the message it answers.** The Client
    and a Gateway route replies by that field alone and drop a reply without it. The throttled
    reply of clause 23 therefore names the Agent that sent the message, and only that Agent. The
    other `Unavailable` replies carry it too, within ADR-0026 and ADR-0030. Those replies are:
    - the Agent-record ceiling in `fleet.rs`;
    - a CSR held back for its audit record;
    - the full enrolment queue and the closed enrolment window in `Fleet::enrol`.

    An undecodable message has no `instance_uid`, so its throttled reply carries none, and no Agent
    receives it.

26. **The tables are bounded.** The buckets live in memory and nothing persists them. They are kept
    in two tables:
    - Buckets keyed by host, by issuer and serial, or by an enrolling peer's address, and the
      Gateways' aggregates, hold at most `revocation::MAX_ISSUED` (100 000) entries, the
      certificate register's own capacity.
    - Buckets keyed by a Gateway's host and an `instance_uid` hold at most `max_agents` entries
      (default 100 000), the fleet's own ceiling.

    When a table is full, a new key evicts the bucket that was used least recently. Eviction can
    only grant tokens, never withhold them, because a new bucket starts full. Its worst case is a
    peer that refills its own bucket early, and filling a table to that end takes as many keys in
    use as the table holds.

27. **The audit records every throttled message and download as a refusal.** Each one is passed to
    the audit record (ADR-0030) as event `agent_rate.throttled` with outcome `throttled`. The entry
    carries:
    - the peer address;
    - `host`, or `serial` and the CA role where the certificate names no host;
    - `instance_uid`, hex, where the message carries a valid one;
    - `bucket`: `agent`, `host` or `gateway`, naming the bucket that was empty;
    - `route`: `opamp` with the `transport`, or `download`.

    The entries are aggregated under ADR-0030 clause 5, by event and peer address. A host that
    floods costs at most ten entries and one `agent_rate.throttled.aggregated` count per address and
    second. The refusal never waits for its entry. A refusal that finds the audit channel full is
    counted in the next entry's `unrecorded_before` (ADR-0030 clause 6). A message or download the
    limit lets through is recorded by nothing new.

**Out of scope:** authentication on either plane and what a client certificate must prove,
including whether the Agent plane's handshake requires it
([ADR-0026](0026-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md));
connection settings and the heartbeat offer
([ADR-0027](0027-connection-settings-offered-without-a-credential-and-server-capabilities.md)); the rate of
admission attempts; which hosts a Client downloads from
([ADR-0018](0018-signed-package-delivery-from-allowed-sources.md)); where its own telemetry goes
([ADR-0022](0022-own-telemetry-over-tls-1-3-and-plaintext-only-to-the-loopback.md)); response
compression on plain HTTP; a connection cap on the Client's own listeners — the Gateway
endpoint and the Supervisor Endpoint — which carry the bounds of `opamp`'s listener and no cap; a
rate limit on the Operator plane, guarded by ADR-0026 clauses 2 and 24; a rate limit of the
Gateway's downstream endpoint, which applies none of its own and forwards the Server's
`Unavailable` unchanged; limits per message kind, or limits that weigh a message by its cost; the
rate of WebSocket upgrades and TLS handshakes; and whether the Client's downloader honours
`Retry-After`.

## Alternatives considered

- **One transport first** — WebSocket-only would put a deviation in `CONFORMANCE.md` for the simpler
  of the two transports and lock out HTTP-polling clients; HTTP-only caps the control loop at poll
  latency, and Gateway multiplexing is specified in WebSocket terms.
- **Separate endpoints or ports per transport** — the Baseline's default is one path, one port,
  per-request detection; splitting would be a deviation with no gain.
- **`native-tls`/OpenSSL** — system headers on Linux plus SChannel/SecureTransport variance on the
  Windows and macOS builds, against one pure-Rust stack identical everywhere.
- **rustls with the default `aws-lc-rs` provider** — needs cmake, which the Dev Container
  deliberately lacks. Revisit if FIPS becomes a requirement.
- **A hand-rolled HTTP client on raw hyper instead of `reqwest`** — polling with gzip, TLS and
  timeouts is reqwest's job; it is client-side only.
- **One listener, authenticated by path prefix** — leaves both audiences on one exposure and one
  TLS policy, and the port, the only thing a firewall can act on, says nothing about who is talking.
- **Split strictly by path — everything under `/api/v1` moves** — puts the download on a port an
  Agent cannot derive, turning `advertised_url` into an obligation whose omission shows up as a
  failed rollout, not a startup error.
- **Three listeners (OpAMP, downloads, Operator)** — a moving part nothing needs; `advertised_url`
  covers the mirror case.
- **The download route on both listeners** — one resource at two addresses under two policies
  invites protecting one and forgetting the other, and the offer names only one.
- **A reverse proxy that splits the planes** — makes a security property depend on an artifact
  this project does not ship or test, and a TLS-terminating proxy cannot give the Agent plane a
  handshake-level client-certificate requirement.
- **Operator plane on `0.0.0.0:4321` by default, or a merged single-port mode** — the first is the
  same exposure on a new port; the second is two operating modes, one of which is the one the split
  exists to avoid.
- **A `tower-http` `TimeoutLayer`** — middleware runs after hyper has parsed the request line and
  headers, so it cannot see the phase at issue, and it would need exclusions for the WebSocket, the
  download and the upload.
- **A deadline per body** — refuses the large upload over a slow link, which is legitimate; any
  value long enough for it leaves the trickle in place.
- **An idle timeout between chunks** — catches a body that stops, not one that sends a byte just
  inside the timeout, which is the cheaper attack.
- **The floor on the package upload alone** — the upload is the longest body, not the only one: the
  Agent plane's `POST`, which faces the estate, and the Operator plane's JSON routes can be trickled
  the same way.
- **A sliding window** — bounds the gap between two bytes more tightly, at the price of keeping the
  arrival times of every chunk; consecutive windows bound the same attack to twice the window.
- **A `server.toml` and `supervisor.toml` key for the floor** — the value depends on what a link
  can carry, which is the same everywhere a program can be delivered at all.
- **Waiting for the axum release carrying the timer** — fixes only `axum::serve`; the TLS listeners
  run on `axum_server` anyway.
- **Keeping `axum::serve` and hand-rolling the accept loop on `hyper-util`** — the same knob for the
  price of owning connection tracking and shutdown, which `axum_server` implements.
- **A per-plane `header_read_timeout_secs` key** — a key whose only sensible value is the framework
  default is a knob nobody turns.
- **The bound as a shared layer in `crates/opamp`** — it is one framework's builder knob in one
  binary; the Client's outbound transports have no counterpart
  ([ADR-0025](0025-five-crates-a-publishable-communication-layer-and-toml-configuration-axum-without-its-websocket.md)).
- **The weaker posture: TLS 1.2 and 1.3, optional TLS, plaintext on any address, an Agent plane on
  `0.0.0.0:4320` and `ws://` as the Client's default** — a Server that starts with no
  configuration and a fleet that connects without certificates are convenient. Rejected: security
  comes before convenience, and Q-1 asks for a refusal at startup, not a working insecure default.
- **Plaintext allowed with a warning off LOOPBACK** — a warning is read after the credential has
  crossed the network. Q-1 asks for a refusal that names the setting.
- **`localhost` and private ranges as loopback** — a host name is whatever the resolver answers,
  and an RFC 1918 address leaves the host. Only the two literals cannot.
- **Plaintext on the Operator plane on LOOPBACK** — the loopback does not leave the host. Not
  chosen: `[tls]` is required anyway, and one rule for both planes leaves nothing to get wrong. A
  browser on the host reaches the plane by the Server's name over an SSH tunnel, or trusts a
  certificate that names `127.0.0.1`.
- **HTTP/2 bounds and connection caps as `server.toml` keys alike** — a cap depends on the size of
  the fleet, so an operator must be able to raise it. The HTTP/2 numbers depend on the protocol's
  use, which is the same in every deployment.
- **A rate-limit bucket per peer address.** Hosts behind one NAT, or every Agent behind a Gateway,
  would share one budget, and one busy neighbour would throttle the rest. The certificate names the
  host exactly, and admission has already proved it.
- **A bucket per `instance_uid` for every peer.** The uid is self-asserted (ADR-0026 clause 14), so
  a peer that wants more messages names a fresh uid for each one, and the limit binds nothing.
- **Behind a Gateway, per-uid buckets alone.** A downstream peer that cycles uids gets a fresh,
  full bucket each time. `max_carried_agents` does not bound that, because each plain-HTTP
  exchange is a downstream connection of its own. The aggregate is what bounds the Gateway.
- **Behind a Gateway, one bucket for the host alone.** A whole site would share one host's budget,
  and one looping Agent behind the Gateway would throttle every other Agent it carries. The per-uid
  bucket inside the aggregate keeps that to the Agent that loops.
- **A bucket per connection.** A peer opens another connection, up to the cap. A poller has no
  connection that outlives one exchange, so there would be nothing to count it on.
- **`429` or `503` with `Retry-After` on `/v1/opamp` over plain HTTP.** The Baseline gives these to
  refusing a connection, and `Retry-After` to reconnect attempts. One protocol-level answer on both
  transports keeps an over-rate member apart from the failed-admission throttle. The download route
  has no protocol-level answer, so `429` is its answer (clause 24).
- **Leaving the download route uncounted.** The connection cap and the pace floor bound how many
  downloads are open and how slowly they run, but not how often a member asks. Once each request
  scans the fleet under its lock, a member asking in a loop holds that lock from every Agent.
- **Closing the WebSocket on the first message over the limit.** The Baseline leaves the
  disconnect to the Client, and closing gives the Agent no `retry_info`, only a reconnect at its
  backoff.
- **`retry_info` as the time until the next token.** That is at most 100 ms at the defaults, and a
  WebSocket Client reconnects at that pace. Every reconnect costs a TLS handshake and an admission
  entry, and it brings a full report from every Agent at once, which can run into the limit again.
  30 s is the Baseline's recommended minimum and what every other `Unavailable` of this Server
  says.
- **A small `burst`, such as 50.** A host speaking for more Agents than `burst` could never get the
  full reports it sends after a reconnect through.
- **An enrolment connection counted by its bootstrap certificate's issuer and serial.** One
  bootstrap certificate may serve the whole fleet, so every enrolling host would share one bucket,
  and enrolment is already bounded by the window, the queue and the approval.
- **Refusing a `messages_per_sec` that cannot carry 256 Agents at the heartbeat.** A limit set too
  low costs availability, not security, and a fleet whose hosts carry few Agents may want it low.
  A warning names the keys.
- **Evicting a full bucket before any other.** Evicting a bucket that is not full only grants
  tokens, so there is nothing to protect.
- **Dropping the message silently.** The Agent would not learn that it should slow down, and on
  plain HTTP an exchange always has a reply.
- **`0` to switch the limit off.** A limit that one line disables is not a default an operator can
  rely on (Q-1). A fleet that needs more raises the numbers.

## Consequences

- Positive: full transport conformance on both ends; any third-party client or server pairs with
  this project regardless of its transport choice; one TLS stack, identical on Linux, macOS and
  Windows, and the client cross-builds need no system TLS library.
- Positive: no credential, configuration or package crosses the network unencrypted, and nothing
  older than TLS 1.3 is negotiated. A configuration that would break this does not start, and its
  message names the setting to fix.
- Positive: the default publishes neither plane on the network; authenticating the Operator plane
  is a decision about one listener, with no per-path exemption for Agent traffic.
- Positive: an unauthenticated peer cannot pin a connection open indefinitely on either plane,
  cannot hold more connections than the cap, and cannot hold an HTTP/2 connection with silent or
  unbounded streams. Both planes drain on shutdown within a bound.
- Positive: no peer holds a connection by stalling or trickling a body or a message, on any
  listener, while a large upload over a slow link and an idle session are left alone.
- Positive: one host, one Agent behind a Gateway, or one Gateway as a whole can no longer take the
  Server's time from the rest of the fleet, on `/v1/opamp` or on the download route. What a looping
  or compromised member costs is bounded by numbers in `server.toml` (Q-2, Strategy *Security
  before convenience*).
- Positive: the rate limit's answer is the protocol's own on both transports, and the Client of
  this project honours it once the reply names its Agent. A throttled message loses nothing,
  because `ReportFullState` recovers the Agent's state at its next processed message.
- Positive: the limit follows the identity admission proved. Hosts behind one NAT do not share a
  budget, and a site behind a Gateway is not throttled as one host.
- Positive: every `Unavailable` reply of this Server reaches its Agent, directly and behind a
  Gateway, so the Client waits as it is told.
- Positive: the Server emits throttling itself, so the *Retrying, throttling, bad request* row and
  the Deviations table of `CONFORMANCE.md` follow the implementation.
- Negative / trade-offs: a Server with no configuration no longer starts. The operator provides a
  certificate and key before the first start, and sets `listen` before an Agent from another host
  can connect.
- Negative / trade-offs: a third-party client or server that speaks only TLS 1.2 cannot pair with
  this project, and a Client whose configuration names a `ws://` or `http://` endpoint off
  LOOPBACK, or a host name such as `localhost`, stops at startup until the endpoint is changed.
- Negative / trade-offs: two transports mean two code paths and reconnect behaviour to test on each
  end; `reqwest` is a sizeable dependency for a poll loop.
- Negative / trade-offs: every operator entry point is on port 4321, and driving the API from
  another host takes a deliberate `[rest] listen` with TLS and authentication. On LOOPBACK the
  Operator plane serves plaintext even when `[tls]` is set. The download route is absent from the
  OpenAPI document, so a generated client has no method for it — no operator flow calls it.
- Negative / trade-offs: a body or a message over a link slower than about a kilobyte a second is
  refused, and a peer that holds the floor exactly still holds its connection for as long as its
  body lasts — about eleven days for a 1 GiB upload — bounded by the connection cap alone.
- Negative / trade-offs: a peer needing more than 30 s for its headers is hung up on. A fleet
  reconnecting after a restart meets the connection cap if it is larger than the cap, and the
  HTTP/2 numbers are chosen, not yet measured against a real fleet.
- Negative / trade-offs: a throttled WebSocket Client disconnects and returns after 30 s, as the
  Baseline asks, so throttling costs a host up to 30 s of reports from every Agent on that
  connection. On its return a `burst` of 300 lets one full report from each Agent through.
- Negative / trade-offs: the rate-limit defaults leave little headroom: 256 Agents at a 30 s
  heartbeat send about 8.5 messages a second against 10. A shorter offered heartbeat on a host near
  256 Agents needs a higher `messages_per_sec`, and the startup warning says so.
- Negative / trade-offs: a downstream peer behind a Gateway that names a neighbour's `instance_uid`
  drains that Agent's bucket, and the neighbour is throttled. This is no worse than what ADR-0034
  already accepts behind a Gateway, where such a peer takes over the neighbour's route. A peer that
  cycles uids is bounded by the Gateway's aggregate, which every Agent behind that Gateway shares.
- Negative / trade-offs: an over-limit download fails that download attempt on the Client, which
  does not honour `Retry-After` there.
- Negative / trade-offs: a throttled `agent_disconnect` is not processed. Over a WebSocket the
  record is marked disconnected when the socket closes. Over plain HTTP it stays connected until it
  goes stale.
- Negative / trade-offs: the Baseline describes `UNAVAILABLE` as an overloaded Server, and here it
  answers one host or Gateway over its rate while the Server has time to spare. The Agent sees no
  difference, and the protocol has no other retryable answer.
- Negative / trade-offs: an aggregate audit entry names the peer address, not the host, because
  ADR-0030 aggregates by address. Behind a NAT or a Gateway only the first ten entries of each
  second name the host or the Agent.
- Follow-ups: per-listener TLS material if a deployment needs a public certificate for operators
  and a private one for Agents; a connection cap on the Client's Gateway endpoint; measuring the
  HTTP/2 bounds against a real fleet; reducing clauses 11 and 12 to the framework's defaults once
  axum installs the timer; rate limits weighted by message kind; the Client's downloader honouring

Tests of the rate limit, each marked `Verifies: ADR-0023`:

- `crates/fleet-server/src/agent_rate.rs`:
  - `a_bucket_starts_full_and_refills_at_the_configured_rate` (clause 19);
  - `a_host_is_one_bucket_whatever_its_agents_report`,
    `a_member_certificate_without_a_host_is_counted_by_issuer_and_serial`,
    `an_enrolment_connection_is_counted_by_its_peer_address` and
    `marking_a_gateway_takes_effect_at_the_next_message` (clause 22);
  - `behind_a_gateway_a_message_passes_its_agents_bucket_and_the_aggregate`: a peer cycling fresh
    uids is stopped by the aggregate, and one looping uid is stopped by its own bucket while
    another uid passes (clause 22);
  - `a_message_naming_no_agent_behind_a_gateway_counts_in_the_aggregate_alone` (clause 22);
  - `a_full_table_evicts_the_bucket_used_least_recently` and `both_tables_are_bounded`
    (clause 26).
- `crates/fleet-server/src/config.rs`:
  - `the_agent_rate_limit_defaults_and_refuses_zero`: the defaults are 10, 300, 500 and 10 000, a
    `0` in any key is refused naming it, and an unknown key is refused (clause 19);
  - `a_limit_below_the_heartbeat_for_256_agents_warns_naming_both_keys`: `messages_per_sec = 5`
    with `heartbeat_interval_secs = 30` warns, naming both keys, and starts; the defaults do not
    warn (clause 20).
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/ws_transport.rs`:
  `a_session_past_its_burst_is_answered_unavailable_with_retry_info`. A member sends `burst + 1`
  messages, and the last reply carries `Unavailable`, a `retry_info` of exactly 30 s and the
  message's `instance_uid`. The connection stays open, the Agent's record is unchanged, and once
  the bucket refills the next message is processed with `ReportFullState` set (clauses 21, 23, 25).
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/http_transport.rs`:
  `a_poller_past_its_burst_is_answered_unavailable_in_the_body`: a `200` carrying the same
  `ServerToAgent`, never a `429` or a `503` (clause 23).
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/packages.rs`:
  `a_download_past_the_limit_is_answered_429_after_thirty_seconds`. A member over its rate gets
  `429` with `Retry-After: 30`, its next download is admitted once the bucket refills, and the
  refusal counts no failure toward the throttle of ADR-0026 clause 24 (clauses 21, 24).
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/mutual_tls.rs`:
  - `two_certificates_of_one_host_share_a_bucket_and_two_hosts_do_not` and
    `a_bootstrap_certificate_shared_by_two_addresses_is_two_buckets` (clause 22);
  - `a_throttled_message_leaves_an_aggregated_refusal_naming_the_host`: beyond ten a second, the
    entries are counted in `agent_rate.throttled.aggregated` (clause 27);
  - `every_unavailable_reply_names_the_agent_it_answers`: each of these carries the message's
    `instance_uid` (clause 25):
    - the throttled reply;
    - the Agent-record ceiling;
    - a CSR held back for its audit record;
    - the full enrolment queue;
    - the closed enrolment window.
- `crates/fleet-server/src/audit_log.rs`:
  `a_throttle_refusal_that_finds_the_channel_full_is_counted_unrecorded` (clause 27).
- `crates/fleet-agent/tests/gateway_revocation_e2e.rs`:
  `a_throttled_agent_behind_a_gateway_hears_unavailable_and_its_neighbour_does_not`. Two Agents
  ride one folded connection to a marked Gateway, and one floods. It alone receives the
  `Unavailable`, routed by its `instance_uid`, and the other's reports keep being processed
  (clauses 22, 23, 25).

**Not mechanically decidable:** clauses 12 and 13 — a 10-second handshake deadline and a 10-second
shutdown drain are named constants in `listen.rs`, and no test waits them out; review keeps both
planes on `listen::plane` and the shared `Handle`. Clause 17 — the HTTP/2 stream cap and keep-alive
bounds are named constants set in `opamp::server::listen`, and the workspace has no HTTP/2 client to
drive a peer past them; review checks that every listener goes through `Listener::serve`.
