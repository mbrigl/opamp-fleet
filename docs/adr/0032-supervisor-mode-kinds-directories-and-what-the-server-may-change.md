# ADR-0032: Supervisor Mode is a hexagonal core whose compiled-in kinds are the authority on their own agents, each Supervisor owns one directory and runs only a program installed there, and the Server manages the set and each Supervisor's configuration only as far as the package signature and the host allow

## Context

The Supervisors that [ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md) binds are the reason the
client side exists: many Managed Processes per Client, each appearing to the Server as its own
Agent, multiplexed by `instance_uid`. A Managed Process takes one of three integration paths
([specification vocabulary](../SPECIFICATION.md)): a Collector carrying the `opampextension`, which
reports its own description, health and effective configuration to the Supervisor Endpoint; a
Collector without it, observed from the outside; and a Foreign Agent under a Custom Supervisor,
whose lifecycle, configuration and health a Plugin translates into OpAMP.

The specification asks for a hexagonal core: the supervision domain written against two Ports, the
Server-facing side speaking OpAMP and the Managed-Process side (lifecycle, configuration, health),
with Plugins as adapters. [ADR-0031](0031-five-crates-the-whole-opamp-communication-layer-in-the-opamp-crate-and-toml-configuration.md) keeps such seams as
modules until a need makes them crates and requires a typo in the hand-edited TOML to fail loudly
at startup. serde cannot combine `#[serde(flatten)]` with `deny_unknown_fields`
(serde-rs/serde#1547), so a block whose kind-specific keys sit beside the common ones cannot be one
strict struct.

The reference `opampsupervisor` runs a local OpAMP server on
`ws://127.0.0.1:{{port}}/v1/opamp` (WebSocket only), passes configuration to the Collector via
`--config`, restarts it on a configuration change, stops it with SIGTERM then a kill after a
timeout, and watchdog-restarts it with exponential backoff. It configures its agent generically —
an absolute `agent.executable` plus `args` — because it supervises a binary somebody else
installed. This Client is in the opposite position: it installs every program it supervises, into
a directory it owns, from an artifact this project packs (clauses 21 and 24). It is the one end that can know an
agent's layout, and `opamp-fleetctl package fetch` already carries per-agent knowledge (service name,
release source, default Configuration names). Writing that knowledge into every host's TOML by
hand — two platform-specific blocks for the GLPI Agent, nine layout keys for Icinga 2 — is a
transcription that goes stale when an artifact moves.

Agents differ in how they are installed, configured, reloaded and removed. Some re-read their
configuration on a signal and lose buffered state when restarted; systemd treats reload as
first-class beside restart (`ExecReload`, `reload-or-restart`). OpAMP itself only ever drives
configuration and packages, and its only process command is restart.

A package update swaps files: the running program is renamed aside, the artifact is written beside
it and renamed into place ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)). All of that needs
write permission on the **directory**. A program in a system directory such as `/usr/local/bin`
cannot be updated by a Client that does not run as root, and the failure would appear at rollout
time on every matched host rather than at startup on one. A Client that also supervised programs
installed by someone else would have two kinds of Managed Process — one it can update, roll back
and health-gate, one it merely runs — and every package, version and rollback decision would carry
both cases. Repacking vendor software into relocatable trees ([ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md),
[ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)) brings such agents under fleet ownership instead.

`state_dir` is state: hardened hosts mount `/var/lib` `noexec` and size it for state, not for
several Collector binaries. An artifact staged under one filesystem and installed on another is
copied, a second full write of a program of several hundred megabytes.

A Foreign Agent is told where its configuration is through its own command line, and an absolute
path written there drifts silently when the Supervisor's directory moves or the Supervisor is
renamed: the process starts happily on a file nobody writes to.

What the fleet needs to manage on a Client is which Supervisors it runs. Everything else in
`supervisor.toml` ([ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md)) — the Server
endpoint, the credential, the state directory, the instance name — is host-local trust and wiring;
a Server that could rewrite it could cut a Client off with one bad push. The specification allows
an Agent's effective configuration to "merge in local configuration". The program a Supervisor
spawns is itself a trust anchor: a Server — or someone who has compromised it without the
package-signing key — that could name any program on the host would have fleet-wide code execution
that bypasses signature verification entirely.

Keeping a delivered block to a program from its own directory — a program that arrived as a signed
package — prevents the "fleet-wide code execution that bypasses signature verification entirely"
the paragraph above describes. It is not enough on its own: a block's `env` and `args` would pass
to that program unchecked, with placeholders expanded in both (clause 26). A Server that delivers a
shared object as a configuration entry and then a block with `LD_PRELOAD` pointing at it has the
loader run that object as the Client's account — root or LocalSystem by default — and any signed program that loads a plugin or a script named in its
arguments reaches as far. The `icinga2` kind reads `ticket_file` from any path on the host and sends
its content to the parent the block names; a delivered block naming `/etc/shadow` and a parent the
attacker runs sends that file there. Both were found by measure H14 of
[`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md) and recorded as H21 and H22. The specification puts security
before convenience; what a compromised Server can make a Supervisor block do on a host must stop at
the signature. What an Agent's own configuration language allows its process to do stays the
product's.

A host must be able to keep its Supervisor set from the Server, while clause 33 makes the
Server's set authoritative for a Client once an offer has applied. Who manages a host's Supervisor
set is one question, answered for the fleet and, by a switch, for one host (clauses 41 to 47).
Which Supervisors take their configuration from the Server is a question of the same host-local
section, answered per Supervisor by clauses 48 to 55.

A remote configuration is one of the channels by which the Server causes code to run on a host
([`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md), *The channels that put code on the host*): the Server can
write any files into a Supervisor's own `config/` directory and restart its process, and what the
agent's configuration language allows — a Telegraf `inputs.exec`, an Icinga `CheckCommand`, a
Collector receiver bound to any port — it allows as the process's account. Package delivery on the
same channel stops at a signature the operator's key makes
([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)); a remote configuration has no
such stop. An operator may run an agent whose configuration is too sensitive to take from a
compromised Server, or which another system already configures, and every Supervisor's Agent
declaring `AcceptsRemoteConfig` as part of the constant `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` gives the host no way
to say so. A switch per Supervisor binds a name, not an agent, while the Server manages the set:
the Server can remove a listed Supervisor and deliver the same agent under another name, which is
not listed. Through the set the Server adds, changes, restarts and purges Supervisors on the host
(*The channels that put code on the host*). The specification puts security before convenience
(Q-1), and the Baseline allows remote configuration to be switched off: *"Remote configuration
capability can be disabled if necessary"* (OpAMP specification, *Configuration*).

What the Server may change on a host is bounded by what the host takes, not by what the Server
sends. The Server manages the set of `[[supervisor]]` blocks through the Client's own Agent, and
every other key of `supervisor.toml` — among them the `[supervisors]` section — is host-local and
out of its reach (clause 27). A switch written inside a `[[supervisor]]` block would be one the
Server can delete by delivering the block again without it. The switches therefore live in
`[supervisors]`, the one per Supervisor keyed by the Supervisor's `name`, which is unique across
blocks and names its directory (clause 3).

The Client's own Agent is built by `AgentState::new` in
`crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/agent.rs` and declares the constant `AGENT_CAPABILITIES`:
`ReportsStatus`, `AcceptsRemoteConfig`, `ReportsEffectiveConfig`, `ReportsRemoteConfig`,
`ReportsHealth`, `AcceptsOpAmpConnectionSettings`, `ReportsConnectionSettingsStatus` and
`ReportsOwnMetrics`, `ReportsOwnTraces` and `ReportsOwnLogs`. `build_engine` in
`crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/mod.rs` adds `ReportsHeartbeat` when heartbeats are enabled,
and `AcceptsPackages` with `ReportsPackageStatuses` when `[self_update]` consents and a
verification key is configured ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)).
Its effective configuration is the redacted text of `supervisor.toml`. Only `AcceptsRemoteConfig`
and `ReportsRemoteConfig` concern the set. Clauses 50 and 51 build the same mechanism for a
Supervisor: `AgentState` can be restored without both bits, and then ignores an offer that arrives
anyway and logs it once per hash in a bounded set (`ignored_configs`).

The Client's own Agent stores an applied set too. `config_applied` writes it with
`store_remote_config` once the Supervisor-set apply succeeded: `remote-config.pb` and one copy of
each entry under `config/`, both in `state_dir`. Nothing runs on those files, since the set they
carry is already in `supervisor.toml` (clause 31). Restoring them at start reports
`RemoteConfigStatus` `APPLIED` with the stored hash, which tells the Server the Client runs that
set, and the Server offers a set only while the reported hash differs
([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clause 6).

The Server offers a remote configuration only to an Agent declaring `AcceptsRemoteConfig`
(ADR-0025 clause 6, `offer` in `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs`), as the Baseline requires,
and a Client's capabilities bind what it reports and acts on
([ADR-0013](0013-connection-settings-offered-without-a-credential-and-server-capabilities.md)
clauses 12 and 17); the same rule read the other way means an Agent that does not declare a
capability does not act on it. A Client whose own Agent, or a Supervisor's Agent, does not declare
the bit is therefore offered no remote configuration, with no change on the Server.

What a Supervisor runs without a remote configuration follows from how each kind finds its
configuration. Every kind reads it from the Supervisor's own `config/` directory,
`<supervisor_dir>/<name>/config/` (clause 21), where `store_remote_config` writes one file per entry
and records roles in `.supplementary` ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clause
9):

- `collector` passes every unroled file in `config/` as its own `--config`, then the block's
  `args`; with no such file it does not start and reports *awaiting configuration*
  (`collector_spec`, clause 6).
- `command` always starts with the block's `args` and `env`; whatever configuration the Foreign
  Agent reads is the one those arguments name, `${config_dir}` included.
- `telegraf` starts with `--config <config_dir>/telegraf-conf`; with no such file Telegraf exits and
  the Runner reports it ([ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md)).
- `glpi` starts with `--conf-file=<config_dir>/glpi-agent-conf` ([ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md)).
- `icinga2` takes as its root the entry with `role = "main"` in `.supplementary`, else
  `icinga2-conf`; with neither it does not start and reports *awaiting Icinga's root
  configuration* ([ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)). Its `ticket_file` and `trusted_cert_file` are
  the block's, wherever they point.

A Supervisor's stored `remote-config.pb` itself is read by no kind. It restores, at start, the
`RemoteConfigStatus` `APPLIED` with the stored hash and the configuration the Agent echoes as its
effective one (`AgentState::new`). What a kind runs on is the entry files beside it. Ignoring the
`.pb` alone would leave a listed Supervisor running the Server's last configuration from those
files.

A `[[supervisor]]` block configures its process too, not only the files in `config/`, and the
Server delivers the blocks. A `collector` or `command` block does it through `args` and `env`: a
Collector reads a whole configuration from `--config=yaml:…` or `--config=env:VAR`, and where the
operator set `[supervisors] delivered_args` or `delivered_env`, a block the Server delivers may
bring new ones (clause 38). The other keys of a block do it as well. An `icinga2` block's
`node_name` and `parent_host` say which parent the agent enrols with and under what name, and its
`trusted_cert_file` pins that parent's certificate. Clause 39 lets a delivered block point
`trusted_cert_file` at a file inside its own `config_dir`. For a listed Supervisor no remote
configuration writes that file, so it does not exist. `ensure_enrolled` in
`crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/icinga2.rs` skips a `trusted_cert_file` that is not a file and
falls back to `pki save-cert`, trust on first use. A delivered block that changes the parent and
points the pin at a missing file therefore enrols the operator's agent with a parent the Server
chose, trusting whatever certificate it presents. For a listed Supervisor any key a delivered block
may change is a remote configuration under another name.

## Decision

We will implement Supervisor Mode as a hexagonal supervision core in the Client crate whose
Managed-Process Port is one closed, channel-based lifecycle vocabulary served by compiled-in kinds,
each Supervisor its own Agent over the Client's one upstream connection with a WebSocket-only
Supervisor Endpoint, make each kind the authority on its own agent so that a `[[supervisor]]` key
exists only where its value is a decision, give every Supervisor one directory it owns under a root
the operator can place, accept only programs this Client installs into that directory, point
Foreign Agents at it by placeholder, and let the Server replace the set of `[[supervisor]]` blocks —
and nothing else in the file — purging a removed Supervisor's directory with it, unless the host
sets `[supervisors] server_manages_set = false`, while a delivered block may bring no environment,
arguments or host paths that reach past what its package's signature covers, and let the operator
name Supervisors in `[supervisors] remote_config_disabled`, whose Agents neither declare nor act on
remote configuration and run only on what the operator placed on the host.

1. **Two Ports, as modules.** The Managed-Process Port is a message pair — `ProcessCommand` in,
   `ProcessEvent` out — plus a `Plugin` factory trait that validates a block's settings
   (`check`, side-effect free) and starts the adapter task (`start`). Channels keep the trait
   object-safe without `async-trait`, make every adapter a plain tokio task, and keep the core
   free of process handles. The Server-facing Port is the engine seam the transports consume —
   build reports, handle a `ServerToAgent`, produce disconnects — over *n* Agents.

2. **A compiled-in registry selected by `type`.** The shipped kinds are `collector` (the
   Collector Supervisor), `command` (the Custom Supervisor for any Foreign Agent), and the wrapped
   kinds `icinga2`, `glpi` and `telegraf`. A new process kind is one module and one registry line
   (`registry()` in `supervisor/mod.rs`); the core stays untouched. An unknown `type` fails startup
   naming the known ones. Plugins are not loaded dynamically.

3. **A block is parsed in two stages.** The core takes the common keys — `type`, `name`,
   `service_name` ([ADR-0015](0015-what-an-agent-reports-about-itself.md)), `endpoint_port`,
   `program_path` ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)), `stop_timeout_secs`,
   `apply_grace_secs`, `retain_previous_secs` — and the program key the kind names (`binary` for
   `collector`, `command` for `command`), which clause 22 resolves. Everything else is the kind's,
   parsed with `deny_unknown_fields`. `name` follows the instance-name grammar of [ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md), because it is
   a directory name, and is unique across blocks.

4. **Each Supervisor is one Agent; the pool is one connection.** Every Supervisor has its own
   persisted `instance_uid`, `sequence_num` and capability set, and all of them ride the Client's
   single upstream connection, disambiguated by `instance_uid` alone — the n-over-m model of
   [ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md) with m fixed at one. The Client's own Agent
   ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)) is always present beside them, with or without
   any `[[supervisor]]` block. The Server needs no Supervisor-specific code.

5. **The Supervisor Endpoint is WebSocket-only on loopback.** Bound for every Supervisor at start
   to `127.0.0.1:<endpoint_port>` (`0`, the default, is an ephemeral port), so a taken port fails
   the start rather than later; accepted with `tokio-tungstenite`, no HTTP framework in the Client.
   It declares `AcceptsStatus` and `AcceptsEffectiveConfig`, enforces the message size limit, and
   folds **content, not identity**: a connecting process's description, health, effective
   configuration and available components become events of the owning Agent, whose
   `instance_uid` stays the Supervisor's.

6. **Process management follows the reference supervisor.** Spawn via `tokio::process`;
   watchdog-restart an unexpectedly exited process with exponential backoff; stop gracefully with
   SIGTERM → wait up to the stop timeout → kill on Unix, `Child::kill` on Windows. On Client
   shutdown the Managed Processes stop first, then each Agent's `agent_disconnect` goes out, within
   the service managers' stop budgets ([ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md)).
   The Collector Supervisor passes each written configuration entry as its own `--config` (never a
   supplementary entry, [ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md)), appends its extra
   `args`, does not start before a configuration exists, and manipulates no YAML.

7. **Configuration status is health-gated.** `RemoteConfigStatus` is `APPLYING` on receipt,
   `APPLIED` only once the Managed Process has been (re)started on the new files and survived the
   apply grace, and `FAILED` with the error otherwise. A process that exits within the grace fails
   the apply and stays supervised.

8. **The lifecycle vocabulary is closed and every operation runs in the kind's adapter.**
   `ProcessCommand` is `ApplyConfig`, `ApplyPackage`, `Restart` (the Server's restart command:
   respawn on the current files, no configuration acknowledgement), `Shutdown` and `Uninstall`;
   `ProcessEvent` carries description, pid, health, effective configuration, available components,
   and the outcomes `ConfigApplied`, `PackageApplied` and `Uninstalled`. The shared `Runner`
   implements the whole vocabulary — spawn and watchdog, bounded stop, restart as the
   configuration apply, swap-and-gate as the package install, stop-only uninstall — and a kind
   overrides only the steps its agent does differently. A kind that overrides nothing is complete.

9. **Reload is an apply strategy, not a command.** `ApplyConfig` is the only configuration
   operation; the adapter applies it by restart (the default) or by a reload its kind knows, with
   systemd's `reload-or-restart` semantics: a reload that cannot be delivered, or a process that
   dies on it, falls back to a restart on the new files. The health gate of clause 7 applies to
   both paths. The mechanism is the kind's alone — `icinga2` and `telegraf` reload on their own
   signal, `collector`, `command` and `glpi` restart — and no block declares one: a signal written
   for a program the kind knows nothing about is the one value whose error is invisible.

10. **Install and update run behind the Plugin, in one contract.** `ApplyPackage` hands the adapter
    a verified artifact and expects a health-gated outcome with rollback on failure
    ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)). The swap on `InstallTarget` (one file or a
    tree) is the shared default; a kind whose installation is not a file swap implements the step
    itself inside the same contract. Resolving the program and declaring `AcceptsPackages` stay in
    the core (clauses 22 and 23), because a capability the Server acts on must derive from what the core reads, never from per-kind behaviour.

11. **Uninstall undoes what installing did, and the core purges.** A Supervisor removed from the
    set receives `Uninstall` before its directory is purged (clause 34): the adapter stops its
    process, undoes whatever its installs left outside the Supervisor's directory, answers `Uninstalled`
    and exits. The generic uninstall is exactly the bounded graceful stop. An `Err` outcome is
    logged with what could not be undone; it does not hold up the removal. A Supervisor that is
    only changed is stopped, never uninstalled.

12. **The core persists a configuration, the adapter delivers it.** Receiving, validating,
    persisting and status-reporting a remote configuration are OpAMP mechanics, identical for every
    kind, and stay in the core. Everything between the written files and the running process —
    pointing it at them, merging, restart or reload, applying through an API — is the kind's.

13. **Derivable means derived, and decided elsewhere means not written here.** A value this Client
    can compute from the kind, the platform and its own layout is not a block key, and neither is a
    value the fleet is the better place to set. A block carrying such a key fails at startup with a
    message naming the key and what supplies the value — never a silent override. This covers a
    wrapped kind's program key, `program_path`, `service_name`, `endpoint_port` and the three timing
    keys; `command`'s `working_dir` and `reload_signal`; and `[supervisor.attributes]`, since a
    Server label tags one Agent among several ([ADR-0026](0026-the-fleet-record.md)) while the
    Client-wide `[attributes]` describe the host. A configuration a freshly self-updated version
    refuses is that update's failed attempt: a run resolves the update in flight even when the file
    does not load, so the host returns to the version that could read it
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)).

14. **A kind states what it knows, and the spawn applies it.** `Plugin::defaults()` returns
    `KindDefaults`, compile-time constants resolved per platform: the program's file name, its
    `program_path` inside a tree, the `service_name` it presents, its timing corrections (clause
    17), and whether a block may pin `endpoint_port`. Beyond that:
    - **Working directory:** a Managed Process starts in the directory its program lives in —
      `program/` for a single file, the tree root for a tree — unless a kind names another; no
      block sets it. Every path the Client hands a process is absolute.
    - **Directories the agent writes into:** a kind lists them in the process specification
      (`ensure_dirs`), and they are created owner-only **before every spawn**, so a directory
      removed under a running fleet returns on the next restart. They lie outside `program/`,
      which a package swap replaces whole. An installation that fails for want of a directory is
      this Client's failure, not the operator's.
    - **Version:** asking the program for its version is the kind's — `collector`, `icinga2` and
      the wrapped kinds do it themselves. `version_args` exists only on `command`, where it is
      also the preflight a staged program is run with before the running one stops.

15. **Each wrapped agent is decided in an ADR of its own.** The rule here is general; what a
    particular kind knows is not, and an upstream that moves a path should touch one document:
    `glpi` and `telegraf` in [ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md), `icinga2` in
    [ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md). `collector` and `command` are decided in clause 16.

16. **What stays in a block, stays for a stated reason.**
    - `collector` is one kind for both distributions and keeps `binary`: `otelcol` and
      `otelcol-contrib` share a lifecycle, a configuration mechanism and a supervision story, and
      which one a host runs is a decision. Its `service_name` falls back to the program's file
      name.
    - `collector` and `command` keep `args` and `env`: a feature gate or a per-host value read as
      `${env:VAR}` is a decision nothing can derive. The wrapped kinds build both whole and take
      neither; an operator who needs to change how a wrapped agent runs does it in that agent's
      configuration, which the fleet delivers.
    - `endpoint_port` is a key of `collector` only — the one kind whose Managed Process connects to
      the Endpoint. It cannot be derived: the port appears in the Collector configuration the fleet
      delivers, which this Client writes byte for byte and never rewrites. A non-zero value on
      another kind is refused; `0` is the default written out and passes. The default stays
      ephemeral so two Collector Supervisors on one host do not collide.
    - `command` keeps `args`, `env` and `version_args`: without them most Foreign Agents never find
      their configuration and report no version, and each fails visibly when wrong.
    - A wrapped kind may keep a key where a decision exists that nobody else can make — `icinga2`
      keeps its enrolment ([ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)).

17. **Timing is a fleet policy, then a kind's correction — never a host's.** `[supervisors]`
    holds `stop_timeout_secs` (default 10) and `apply_grace_secs` (default 3); `[updates]` holds
    `retain_previous_secs` (default one day, [ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)). A
    wrapped kind may correct any of the three where its agent demands it (Icinga 2's shutdown
    drains for up to a minute), and its blocks may state none of them. Only `collector` and
    `command` blocks may override them, because there no kind exists to hold the value.

18. **A Client reports which kinds it carries.** Its own Agent reports one non-identifying
    attribute per compiled-in kind, `supervisor.kind.<kind> = "true"`, so a Selector can aim a
    Supervisor set at Clients that can run it. One key per kind, because a Selector is equality
    over string values and the question is about one member of the set. An operator's own
    attribute of the same key is left as written. `AvailableComponents` is not used for this: the
    message is *Development* in the pinned Baseline
    ([ADR-0010](0010-the-protocol-is-pinned-and-checked-against-opamp-go-on-the-endpoint-as-it-ships.md)) and Selectors do not match it.

19. **A kind binds itself to one artifact's shape.** The derived paths are those of the artifact
    `opamp-fleetctl package fetch` builds. A tree packed differently does not fit, and the answer is to
    repack it with the tool, not to reopen a key.

20. **Every wrapped agent has an artifact document, pinned by two tests.** The shape a kind runs
    and the tool packs is written once, in `docs/artifacts/<agent>.md`, for the wrapped kinds only
    (`icinga2`, `glpi-agent`, `telegraf`). `collector` needs none: its artifact is installed as
    published, found by the name in `binary`, and handed configurations it does not inspect, so
    there is no second end to keep in step. Each document has the same eight sections: source
    (repository, tag form, version reading); assets per platform and their naming; integrity
    (checksum form and location); treatment (as published, or which repack); shape in the
    delivered tree; what the Client derives from it, per platform, and why; the Configurations the
    tool uploads and what the agent reads them as; and what can change upstream, with the test
    that goes red. Each document is pinned by **one test per side** — one against the tool's `Plan`
    (asset name, checksum source, action, output name), one against the kind's constants (program
    name, `program_path`, derived directories, arguments), `cfg`-gated per platform — and both name
    the document.

21. **One directory per Supervisor, under a relocatable root.** The top-level key `supervisor_dir`
   defaults to `<state_dir>/supervisors` and is made absolute at load. Under it each Supervisor
   owns `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/`, holding everything it needs:

   ```
   <supervisor_dir>/<name>/
     instance-uid            # its Agent identity
     remote-config.pb        # the last received configuration
     installed-package.json  # what is installed
     config/                 # the written configuration entries
     program/<file>          # the Managed Process — or program/tree/<program_path> for a tree
     packages/               # this Supervisor's download staging
   ```

   One knob moves state and program together. Staging beside `program/` makes a raw artifact's
   install a rename on one filesystem. The directory is `program/`, not `bin/`, because it holds a
   whole tree for a multi-file package ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)). Moving
   `supervisor_dir` on a running host leaves the old tree behind and migrates nothing; each
   Supervisor then registers as a new Agent.

22. **The program key is a bare file name.** `binary` (`collector`) and `command` (`command`) take
   a file name with no path separator and no `..`, resolving to `program/<value>` — or to
   `program/tree/<program_path>` when the block names a tree. A wrapped kind names its own program
   (clause 14). Anything else fails at startup:
   - an **absolute path** — and on Windows a rooted path without a drive letter — with a message
     naming the block, the value and the way across: a program the fleet manages reaches the host
     as a package and is named here by its bare file name;
   - any other shape (`./x`, `a/b`, `../x`) with a message naming the rule.

   A bare name cannot escape the directory, so nothing has to be sanitised, and it never searches
   `$PATH`.

23. **Every Supervisor accepts packages.** Since every program lives in a directory this Client
   owns, every Supervisor's Agent declares `AcceptsPackages`; the capability is a constant, not a
   function of the configuration. The `program/` directory is prepared at start, before the first
   package arrives. A block carrying `accepts_packages` fails at startup with a message saying the
   bare file name already makes the program updatable. Startup logs, once per Supervisor, where its
   program is.

24. **A vendor agent is brought in by repacking.** An agent installed by the machine's package
   manager is not supervised here; it is repacked as a relocatable artifact and delivered as a
   package ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md), [ADR-0033](0033-glpi-agent-and-telegraf.md),
   [ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)). The manual documents the fleet-delivered route for every agent it
   describes.

25. **The Client's own consent stays explicit.** `[self_update]` names the package it takes
   ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)); nothing about it is derived from a path. A
   package written over the Client takes the host out of reach, which is where implicit consent
   would be wrong.

26. **Placeholders name a Supervisor's own directories.** In the `args` and `env` values of
   `collector` and `command` blocks, `${supervisor_dir}` expands to `<supervisor_dir>/<name>` and
   `${config_dir}` to `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/config`, where the received configuration's entries
   are written ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md)) — so
   `args = ["-c", "${config_dir}/fluent-bit-conf"]` cannot drift. They are expanded when the
   Supervisor starts, and **never** in the program key, whose written shape is what the operator
   reads. An unrecognised `${…}` is passed through verbatim — neither refused nor emptied — because
   a Foreign Agent's own configuration language may use the same syntax (Fluent Bit's does).

27. **The Server manages the set through the Client's own Agent, and only the blocks are read.** A
   remote configuration offered to the Client's own Agent — a Configuration stated for the Agent
   type `supervisor` ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md)) — is parsed entry by
   entry as TOML. The union of the entries' `[[supervisor]]` blocks, in entry-name order, is the
   offered set; every other top-level key is ignored. The boundary is enforced by what the Client
   takes, not by policing what the Server sends. A duplicate `name` within or across entries, an
   entry that is not TOML, or a block the startup parser would refuse fails the offer.

28. **An offered set is validated as startup would read it, before anything stops.** The merge is
   the running file's globals with the offered blocks. Each block passes the same checks startup
   applies — kind known, program key present and well-shaped, `service_name`, `endpoint_port` and
   timing as this decision allows them, retired keys refused,
   the kind's strict settings parse through the side-effect-free `Plugin::check`. A set that fails
   is reported `FAILED` with the reason; nothing is stopped, nothing is written, the running set
   stays in force.

29. **A delivered block may name only a Client-owned program.** The apply path checks every offered
   block's program resolves inside the Supervisor's own `program/`. Clause 22 already refuses every
   other shape for every principal, so this check cannot fire today; it stays as defence in depth
   against a future shape, in the apply path that knows the block came from the Server.

30. **The apply is a diff keyed by Supervisor `name`, in a fixed order.** Comparing running and
    offered blocks yields removed, changed (any key differs), added and unchanged. Then:
    1. the removed and changed Supervisors stop — a removed one is uninstalled
       (clause 11), a changed one only stopped — and their
       Agents send `agent_disconnect`;
    2. the merged document is written to `supervisor.toml`;
    3. the removed Supervisors' directories are purged (clause 34);
    4. the changed and added Supervisors start from the file just written, an added one introducing
       itself as a new Agent on the running connection.

    Unchanged Supervisors keep running untouched. A failed write restarts the stopped Supervisors
    from the still-standing old file. A crash before the write restarts into the old file, one
    after it into the new one; both converge, because startup builds exactly what the file says.

31. **`supervisor.toml` remains the single truth.** No overlay and no second file: after an apply
    the file is the configuration, the same file the operator reads and the Client's own Agent
    reports as its effective configuration (refreshed in the same step), and an offline restart
    runs the delivered Supervisors because they are in it. Only the `[[supervisor]]` array is
    replaced, by editing the document with `toml_edit`, so the operator's comments, ordering and
    formatting survive byte for byte and the offered blocks keep their text. The write goes through
    a sibling temporary file renamed into place; on Unix it carries the existing file's mode, and a
    file created by the write is `0600`, because it holds the credential.

32. **The status is honest.** The Client's own Agent reports `APPLYING` on receipt, `APPLIED` once
    the file is written and the starts have succeeded, and `FAILED` when parsing, validation, the
    write or a start fails. A started Supervisor whose process later crashes is a health fact of
    that Supervisor's Agent, not a failed configuration.

33. **No offer, no change.** A Client to which no Supervisor set is offered runs its locally written
    blocks. The first applied offer replaces the local set, and from then on, while `[supervisors]
    server_manages_set` is true, the Server's set is authoritative for that Client's Supervisors
    (clauses 41 to 47); the offer is compared against the file, not against the last offer.

34. **A removed Supervisor is purged.** Removal is keyed by name: only a name absent from the new
    set is removed, while a changed block keeps its directory, identity and installed package. The
    purge runs only after the write succeeded, because a failed write restarts the old set from
    whole directories. It deletes `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/` recursively — program, staging,
    configuration and `instance-uid` — so a Supervisor later re-added under the same name is a new
    Agent, installed afresh.

35. **The purge never leaves the Supervisor root.** A symlink where a Supervisor's directory should
    be is unlinked, never followed, and a directory whose resolved path lies outside the root is
    left alone with a warning.

36. **A directory the purge cannot delete fails nothing.** The Supervisor is already stopped and
    the file written, so the set the Server asked for is running; a purge error (a file held open
    on Windows, permissions) is a warning naming the path, and the directory becomes an orphan.

37. **An orphaned directory is reported at startup, never reaped.** A directory under the root
    that no block names — a purge cut short, a block removed by hand while the Client was down, a
    moved root — is logged as a warning with its path and left in place. Startup cannot tell a
    leftover from a block temporarily commented out, and deleting would cost that Agent its
    identity and program; removing it is the operator's call.

38. **A delivered block brings no environment and no arguments the operator did not allow.** In
    the apply path, a delivered block's `env` entries, `args` and `version_args` must equal those of
    the running block of the same name, or be allowed by the operator in `supervisor.toml`'s
    `[supervisors]` section — keys the Server cannot change (clause 27). `delivered_env` is a list of
    variable names, each exact or ending in `*` as a prefix (`["OTEL_*", "GOMAXPROCS"]`), and
    defaults to none; `delivered_args = true` lets delivered blocks state arguments, and defaults to
    `false`. Names are compared without regard to case, as Windows compares them. Whatever the list
    says, a delivered `env` that adds or changes a variable steering which code a program loads is
    refused: `PATH`, every `LD_*` and `DYLD_*`, `GCONV_PATH`, `GLIBC_TUNABLES`, `OPENSSL_CONF`,
    `OPENSSL_ENGINES`, `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`, `COR_PROFILER*`, `CORECLR_PROFILER*`,
    `NODE_OPTIONS`, `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, `_JAVA_OPTIONS`, `JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS`, `PYTHONPATH`,
    `PYTHONSTARTUP`, `PERL5LIB`, `PERL5OPT`, `RUBYOPT`, `BASH_ENV` and `ENV`. So is a new or
    changed value that contains `${config_dir}` or `${supervisor_dir}`: the Server delivers files
    there that no one signed, and an allowed name such as `OTEL_JAVAAGENT_EXTENSIONS` would load
    one. The list is a floor, not a guarantee: `delivered_env = ["*"]` leaves only it between a
    delivered block and every other variable a program reads. A block that breaks this fails the whole offer before anything
    stops (clause 28), naming the block and the variable or key. A block the operator writes is
    unaffected: the rule is about what the Server may add.

39. **A delivered block names no host path outside its own configuration directory.** A kind
    states which of its settings name a file the Supervisor reads; in a delivered block each must
    be `${config_dir}/` followed by a relative path with no `..`, `.` or root component, unless it
    equals the running block's value and the block still names the same parent and node. The
    `icinga2` kind states `ticket_file` and `trusted_cert_file` ([ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md)); its
    `node_name`, which names the host's certificate and key files, is a plain name with no
    separator in every block. A delivered `icinga2` block that names a `parent_host` must name
    `trusted_cert_file`: trust on first use is for a parent an operator chose, not one the Server
    names. [ADR-0034](0034-icinga-2.md) stands otherwise for an operator-written block.

40. **What is checked is what is written.** The rewritten `supervisor.toml` is rendered before
    anything stops, with every delivered table and its sub-tables placed in the order of the set,
    and the offer is refused unless the rendered file reads back as exactly the set that passed
    clauses 28, 38 and 39.

41. **The key.** `[supervisors] server_manages_set` is a boolean and defaults to `true`, the
    behaviour clauses 27 to 40 describe. It is read when the configuration is loaded, like every key
    of the file, and is never taken from the Server, since the Supervisor-set apply replaces only
    the `[[supervisor]]` array (clauses 27 and 31). A change takes effect at the next start of the
    Client.

42. **The Client's own Agent declares neither remote-configuration capability.** With the key
    `false` it is built without `AcceptsRemoteConfig` and without `ReportsRemoteConfig`. Every
    other capability stays as the context lists it: `ReportsStatus`, `ReportsEffectiveConfig` with
    `supervisor.toml` as its effective configuration, `ReportsHealth`, the connection-settings
    bits, the own-telemetry bits, `ReportsHeartbeat` where enabled, and `AcceptsPackages` with
    `ReportsPackageStatuses` where `[self_update]` consents and a verification key is configured.
    Self-update is a separate consent (clause 25) and is not touched. The Server then offers the
    Client no set ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clause 6).

43. **A set that arrives anyway is ignored.** It is not stored, not applied, and no
    `RemoteConfigStatus` is reported: no Supervisor stops or starts and `supervisor.toml` is not
    written. The Baseline's rule for a part of a message the Agent does not support is that it
    *"SHOULD ignore it"*. The Client logs a warning naming the offered hash once per hash it has
    seen since start, remembering at most as many hashes as it does for a Supervisor under
    clause 51 before it starts over. The Supervisor-set apply itself refuses to run while the key is
    `false` and logs the hash it was handed, so no path that hands it a set gets past the key.

44. **A stored set from before is not restored, and is removed at start.** When the key is
    `false` and `remote-config.pb` exists in `state_dir`, the Client, before it connects:
    - does not restore it, so it reports no `RemoteConfigStatus` and no
      `last_remote_config_hash`;
    - deletes `remote-config.pb` first, so nothing that fails after it can leave the stored hash
      behind;
    - then deletes, as far as it can, each entry copy in `<state_dir>/config/` whose bytes are
      still the ones the stored map holds, leaving every other file there, the comparison
      clause 52 makes for a Supervisor;
    - deletes a `remote-config.pb` that does not decode and leaves `config/` as it is;
    - logs once, naming the stored hash and every copy it kept or could not remove.

    Nothing runs on these files, and the set they carry is already in `supervisor.toml`, so a
    file that cannot be read or deleted is a warning naming the error, and startup continues.
    Kept, `remote-config.pb` would be reported `APPLIED` again once the key returns to `true`,
    and the Server would not offer its set while that hash is unchanged, though the file may by
    then hold the operator's blocks; the warning for `remote-config.pb` itself says so.

45. **The blocks in the file stay, and are the operator's.** Setting the key rewrites nothing:
    every `[[supervisor]]` block stays as it is, including blocks an earlier applied set wrote,
    and the Client runs them as written. From then on only the operator changes them. An operator
    who switches the key off reviews the blocks first, since some of them may be the Server's. A
    Supervisor's own remote configuration is not affected: each Supervisor's Agent keeps taking
    its configuration unless it is named in `remote_config_disabled`. `delivered_args` and
    `delivered_env` keep their meaning and have nothing to act on while no set is delivered.

46. **Together with `remote_config_disabled` it closes what that list leaves open.** With the key
    `false` the Server can neither remove a listed Supervisor nor add the same agent under a name
    that is not listed. The Server can still install a signed package into a Supervisor, restart a
    Managed Process, offer connection settings, and configure every Supervisor not named in
    `remote_config_disabled`.

    What the key holds against the Server holds only while every Supervisor whose configuration
    language can run commands as the Client's account — a Telegraf `inputs.exec`, an Icinga
    `CheckCommand`, the configuration a `command` kind's program reads — is named in
    `remote_config_disabled`. Otherwise the Server can configure such a Supervisor to rewrite
    `supervisor.toml`, and the key flips at the next start. A signed Client build can also still
    replace the Client's own program where `[self_update]` consents
    ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)), and that program reads
    the key.

47. **Switching it back on hands the set to the Server again.** When the key returns to `true`,
    the next start declares both capabilities, reports no hash — unless that earlier start warned
    that it could not remove `remote-config.pb` itself — and is offered whatever set is
    released to the Client's own Agent ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md)).
    The first applied offer replaces the `[[supervisor]]` array, the operator's blocks included,
    and purges each Supervisor it removes (clauses 33 and 34).

48. **The key `remote_config_disabled`.** `[supervisors] remote_config_disabled` is a list of
    Supervisor names and defaults to empty. It is read when the configuration is loaded, like every
    key of the file, and is never taken from the Server: the Supervisor-set apply keeps the running
    file's globals and replaces only the `[[supervisor]]` array (clauses 27, 28 and 31). A Server that
    deletes a listed Supervisor's block and delivers it again under the same name gets a Supervisor
    that is still listed.

49. **A name that matches no block is a notice, not a refusal.** At startup each listed name that
    no `[[supervisor]]` block carries is logged once as a notice naming it, because the set may
    arrive later from the Server. A listed name equal to the Client's own `name` and to no block is
    logged with a notice that the Client's own Agent is not covered; that is clauses 41 to 47. A
    value that breaks the instance-name grammar (clause 3) fails startup naming the key and the
    value, because no block can ever carry it.

50. **A listed Supervisor's Agent declares neither remote-configuration capability.** It is built
    without `AcceptsRemoteConfig` and without `ReportsRemoteConfig`. Every other capability stays as
    it is: `ReportsEffectiveConfig`, `AcceptsRestartCommand`, and `AcceptsPackages` with
    `ReportsPackageStatuses` where a verification key is configured. The Server then offers it no
    remote configuration ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clause 6), and nothing
    on the Server changes.

51. **A remote configuration that arrives anyway is ignored.** It is not stored, no entry file is
    written, nothing is handed to the process adapter, and no `RemoteConfigStatus` is reported,
    since the Agent declares no `ReportsRemoteConfig`. The Baseline's rule for a part of a message
    the Agent does not support is that it *"SHOULD ignore it"*. The Client logs a warning naming
    the Supervisor and the offered hash once per hash it has seen since start, so a Server that
    resends the same offer on every exchange does not flood the log.

52. **A stored remote configuration from before is removed at start, and the operator's files
    stay.** When a listed Supervisor starts — at Client startup, or when a delivered set adds or
    changes it — and a `remote-config.pb` exists in its directory, the Client, before the kind is
    started:
    - deletes from `config/` each entry file the stored map names whose bytes are still the ones
      the map holds, and `.supplementary` if its bytes are still the ones the map would write;
    - leaves every other file in `config/` untouched, since the operator wrote or overwrote it;
    - deletes `remote-config.pb`;
    - logs once, naming the Supervisor, the stored hash, and every file it kept because its content
      had changed.

    A `remote-config.pb` that does not decode is deleted, `config/` is left as it is, and the
    warning says that `config/` may still hold files the Server wrote. No status is restored, so a
    listed Supervisor reports no `RemoteConfigStatus` after a restart and no
    `last_remote_config_hash`.

    Storing an offer (`store_remote_config`) removes the previous entry files, writes the new
    ones, and writes `remote-config.pb` last. A store cut short — a crash or a failed write —
    therefore never leaves a new `.pb` beside the previous offer's files, which the comparison
    above would keep as the operator's. What it can leave is the previous `.pb` beside some of
    the new offer's files. The previous map names none of those, so they stay in `config/`: a
    stop after the first new entry file and before the `.pb` is the one window in which the drop
    cannot tell the Server's files from the operator's.

53. **What a listed Supervisor runs is the operator's.** The kinds are unchanged. A listed
    Supervisor runs on the files the operator places in `<supervisor_dir>/<name>/config/`, under
    the names its kind reads (the context lists them), with roles in `.supplementary` in the format
    `storage.rs` writes. For `collector` and `command` the process also gets the block's `args` and
    `env`, which are the operator's as clause 54 keeps them. With remote configuration switched
    off, nothing else writes into that directory. A listed `collector` or `icinga2` with no such
    file waits and says so, and a listed `telegraf` with none exits and is reported, as each does
    before its first remote configuration.

54. **A delivered block for a listed Supervisor repeats the running block whole.** In the
    Supervisor-set apply, the check of a delivered block (`check_delivered_block` in
    `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/mod.rs`, called from `apply_inner` in
    `crates/fleet-agent/src/reconfigure.rs`) ignores `delivered_args` and `delivered_env` (the
    `SupervisorsConfig` fields of `crates/fleet-agent/src/config.rs`) for a block whose name is in
    `remote_config_disabled`, and holds such a block to this:
    - **A block of that name runs:** the delivered block equals it entirely, compared as the
      parsed block. That covers `type`, the core keys (`service_name`, `endpoint_port`,
      `stop_timeout_secs`, `apply_grace_secs`, `retain_previous_secs`, `program_path`) and every
      kind setting, among them `args`, `version_args` and `env` and an `icinga2` block's
      `node_name`, `parent_host`, `ticket_file` and `trusted_cert_file`. A key the running block
      lacks may not appear, and one it has may not change or go. Absent and empty differ.
    - **No block of that name runs, because the block is added:** the delivered block carries
      nothing beyond what naming its program requires. That is `type` and `name`, plus the kind's
      program key where the kind does not name its own program: `binary` for `collector` and
      `command` for `command`. A `telegraf`, `glpi` or `icinga2` block carries `type` and `name`
      alone, since each of those kinds installs and names its own program and refuses the key
      (clause 13). An added listed `icinga2` is thus a standalone node until the operator writes
      its parent into the host's `supervisor.toml`, and from then on the running block is the one a
      delivered block must equal.

    A block that breaks this fails the whole offer before anything stops, as clauses 28 and 38
    refuse a block: the set is reported `FAILED` with a reason naming the block and the key,
    nothing is stopped, nothing is written, and the running set stays in force. Without this, the
    Server could configure a listed Supervisor through its block instead of its `config/`. It could
    put a configuration on a Collector's command line or into its environment (`--config=yaml:…`,
    `--config=env:VAR`) where `delivered_args` or `delivered_env` allow it. It could also, through
    the `icinga2` keys the context describes, enrol the operator's agent with a parent of the
    Server's choosing on trust on first use. Equality closes that route for every key, including
    keys a kind adds later. A list of the keys that matter would have to be kept current with every
    kind. The Server can still remove a listed block or deliver it unchanged. Delivering it
    unchanged is how a Server that manages the set keeps it.

55. **Switching it back on hands `config/` to the Server again.** When a name leaves the list, the
    next start declares both capabilities, reports no hash, and is offered whatever is released to
    that Agent ([ADR-0036](0036-rollout-and-what-reaches-an-agent.md)). The first stored offer
    replaces every file in `config/` ([ADR-0025](0025-configurations-and-the-rest-api.md) clause 9),
    the operator's included.

**Out of scope:** dynamic plugin loading; plain-HTTP polling on the Supervisor Endpoint;
injecting the `opampextension` configuration into a Collector's configuration; connection pools
larger than one (Gateway Mode, [ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)); reporting the
kinds through `AvailableComponents`; a machine-readable artifact manifest shared by tool and kind;
reconciling a locally edited `[[supervisor]]` set against the last applied offer at startup; an
opt-in reaping of orphaned directories; migrating a Supervisor tree when its root moves; a
supervise-only mode for programs this Client does not install, which would need its own decision
and capability model; how a multi-file tree is unpacked and swapped
([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)); keeping some blocks from the Server while it
manages the others; how the fleet view or the REST API shows that a host keeps its set, beyond the
capability set the Server already lists; any change on the Server, the REST API or the bundled UI
for either switch; the restart command and package delivery to a listed Supervisor, which stay as
they are; what a listed Supervisor reports as its effective configuration when its process reports
none (the empty map, as for any Supervisor before its first remote configuration).

## Alternatives considered

- **Dynamic plugin loading (shared libraries).** Rust has no stable ABI, so it means a C ABI
  boundary, unsafe code and version-skew handling for a third-party capability nobody needs; the
  registry keeps a new kind to one module.
- **A serde tagged enum instead of a registry and a two-stage parse.** It hard-codes every kind's
  settings into `config.rs` and cannot combine with `deny_unknown_fields`.
- **A `Supervisor` trait with async lifecycle methods.** Async trait objects need `async-trait` or
  hand-rolled boxing, and a core that awaits adapter methods couples itself to adapter timing.
  The channel vocabulary is the uniform interface.
- **axum (or hyper) for the Supervisor Endpoint, or plain-HTTP support on it.** The endpoint serves
  one loopback WebSocket peer, which `tokio-tungstenite` already handles; the reference template is
  `ws://`, so HTTP polling would have no consumer.
- **One upstream connection per Supervisor.** The Server routes by `instance_uid` regardless, and
  n-over-1 is the model Gateway Mode generalises.
- **Injecting the extension configuration à la `opampsupervisor`.** It needs a YAML stack and
  templating in Rust; the operator pins `endpoint_port` on the Collector block and the delivered
  configuration names it.
- **A distinct `Reload` command beside `ApplyConfig`.** Nothing upstream asks for a bare reload, so
  it would have no sender; reload is how an apply is executed.
- **Operator-written lifecycle hooks (`reload_cmd`, `uninstall_cmd`, `reload_signal`) in TOML.**
  Kind knowledge belongs in the kind's module, written once and tested; a wrong hook silently
  misbehaves on a host.
- **Moving program resolution and package consent into the plugins.** A fleet-visible capability
  must derive from configuration the core reads.
- **Keep the derivable keys and fix the documentation, or keep them undocumented.** A template is a
  default that cannot be updated, and two sources of truth for a value the Client computes is how
  a host quietly differs from what the fleet believes.
- **Split `collector` into `otelcol` and `otelcol-contrib`.** It moves the distribution decision
  from `binary` into `type` and costs a second plugin for one lifecycle.
- **A machine-readable manifest per agent, read by tool and Client.** It needs a schema, a parser
  on each side and a policy for a manifest newer than the Client; two tests achieve the coupling.
- **Probing the unpacked tree at runtime, or a per-kind defaults file.** A wrong guess is silent on
  a host, and data nothing tests re-creates the transcription; a compiled-in constant fails a test
  when the artifact moves.
- **One list attribute for the kinds.** A Selector could match it only by spelling the whole list.
- **A denylist of dangerous variables alone** — `LD_PRELOAD` is one of many; `PYTHONPATH`,
  `NODE_OPTIONS`, `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`, `BASH_ENV` and every program's own plugin variable reach as
  far, and the list never ends. An allow-list the operator writes ends it; the loader variables are
  refused on top because no Managed Process needs them from the Server.
- **No delivered `env` or `args` at all** — safe, but a fleet that steers its Collectors with
  `OTEL_*` variables or a Fluent Bit's `-c ${config_dir}/…` from the Server would lose that; the
  operator's allow-list keeps it where it is wanted.
- **Clearing the environment of every Managed Process** — the Client's own environment carries what
  the host's agents expect (proxies, locale); clearing it breaks operator-written blocks to protect
  against delivered ones.
- **An `accepts_packages` flag beside a program path that may be absolute.** Two keys for one
  truth that can disagree, and the configuration could express what the filesystem forbids.
- **Probing writability at startup and deriving consent from it.** A fleet-visible capability would
  depend on a `chmod` nobody recorded and race a rollout when permissions change.
- **Supervising machine-installed programs without updating them.** Every package, version and
  rollback decision would carry a second case, the fleet's picture of a host would depend on which
  file a block came from, and an operator "fixing" a path to an absolute one would silently revoke
  a capability.
- **Letting the Server deliver absolute program paths, or allowlisting some per host.** The first
  hands a Server arbitrary code execution outside package signing; the second is host-local policy
  for a capability the fleet path does not need. Warning and applying anyway is not a control.
- **A separate `bin_dir`, or a `supervisor_dir` per block.** Two knobs for a separation nobody has
  asked for; one root per Client matches how the Client's own root is treated.
- **Keeping a bare name as a `$PATH` lookup and requiring `./` for the owned meaning.** A fourth
  case, noise in TOML, to keep behaviour fragile under a service manager's minimal `PATH`.
- **A `versions/` + `current` layout for Managed Processes.** A Managed Process is stopped before
  its swap and `.rollback` covers the fallback; only the running Client needs that layout.
- **Resolving relative arguments against the Supervisor's directory instead of placeholders, or
  exporting the paths as environment variables.** The same-looking rule would mean `program/` for
  one key and the Supervisor root for another, and nothing expands variables in `argv`. A general
  templating engine is far past the need.
- **Refusing unknown `${…}` placeholders.** It would break agents whose own syntax overlaps to
  catch a typo.
- **The Server delivering the whole `supervisor.toml`.** Endpoint, credential and state directory
  are the host's trust anchors; one bad push could leave the Client unreachable.
- **A separate overlay file for the delivered set** (the `opampsupervisor` model). Two files would
  answer "what does this Client run", and an offline restart would depend on state the operator
  never sees.
- **Restarting the Client, or every Supervisor, to apply.** It cycles every healthy Supervisor to
  change one.
- **Failing an offer that carries a non-Supervisor key.** One stray global key would block the
  Supervisors that came with it; the fleet view shows the file that actually runs.
- **Re-serialising the file with the ordinary `toml` writer.** It destroys the operator's comments
  and layout after the first apply.
- **Keeping a removed Supervisor's data, keeping only its identity, a retention window, or renaming
  it aside.** A re-added Supervisor would resurrect a disconnected Agent's identity and stale
  configuration; a split directory is unreasoned; retention exists to roll back a living
  Supervisor, which a removed one is not; a renamed copy is a slower leak.
- **Reaping orphaned directories at startup.** Startup cannot tell a leftover from a deliberate
  hand edit, and the destructive reading deletes an identity that was not meant to go.
- **Default `false` for `server_manages_set`.** Every existing Client would stop following the
  Server's set at upgrade, including hosts that took one, and G-1's loop would no longer close for
  Supervisor sets until each host's file says so. The switch is an operator's narrowing of what
  the Server may do on one host; the default keeps the behaviour clauses 27 to 40 describe.
- **A reserved name in `remote_config_disabled`** (the Client's own `name`, or a fixed name such
  as `supervisor`). The list holds Supervisor names under the instance-name grammar, so any
  reserved literal is a name a block can carry, and the Client's own `name` is the operator's to
  change. One key would mean two things: a Supervisor's configuration and the membership of the
  set. Clause 49 already answers the Client's own name in the list with a notice that it is not
  covered.
- **A key per `[[supervisor]]` block** (`managed_by_server = false`). The Server replaces the
  blocks (clause 27) and could drop the key by delivering the block without it. The decision is
  also about the set: adding a block is the change to stop, and no existing block can say that.
- **Keeping `AcceptsRemoteConfig` and answering every set, or every offer to a listed Supervisor,
  `FAILED`.** The Server would keep offering, the fleet view would show a refusal on every rollout,
  and the Agent would declare a capability it does not exercise.
- **Restoring the stored set, or leaving it on disk unrestored.** Restored, the Server sees a
  set reported `APPLIED` that the host no longer follows. Left on disk, switching back on
  restores its hash, and the Server does not offer an unchanged set to a file the operator may
  have changed since.
- **Failing startup when the stored set cannot be removed.** Clause 52 fails closed because a
  Supervisor runs on its files; nothing runs on these, and a refusal would take the host off the
  fleet for an inert file.
- **A top-level key outside `[supervisors]`.** `[supervisors]` already holds what the host
  allows the Server for its Supervisors (`delivered_env`, `delivered_args`,
  `remote_config_disabled`), and the Server never writes it.
- **A separate ADR beside this one for the switch.** It would make clause 33 untrue for some hosts
  without changing it; who manages a host's set is one decision.
- **A key inside the `[[supervisor]]` block to switch off its remote configuration**
  (`accepts_remote_config = false`). The Server replaces the blocks (clause 27), so it could switch
  the setting back on by delivering the block without the key. A delivered-block check that refuses
  dropping the key would make the operator's choice depend on a rule in the apply path, when it can
  depend on a section the apply path never writes.
- **A Client-wide switch of remote configuration for every Supervisor.** It is too coarse: a host
  that wants one agent's configuration kept local loses fleet configuration for every other agent
  it runs.
- **Ignoring only a listed Supervisor's `remote-config.pb` and leaving `config/` as it is.** The
  kinds read the entry files, not the `.pb`, so the Server's last configuration would go on running
  under a switch that says it does not.
- **Wiping the whole `config/` directory at start.** It would delete the files an operator placed
  there before the restart that put the switch in force.
- **Moving the Server's stored files aside instead of deleting them.** They can carry secret
  material (ADR-0025 clause 9), and nothing needs them back: switching back on reports no hash, so
  the Server offers again what is released.
- **A separate host path for a listed Supervisor's local configuration.** It would be a second
  place each kind reads from, and a block key the Server could rewrite. `config/` is already where
  every kind looks.
- **Letting `delivered_args` and `delivered_env` stand for a listed Supervisor.** They were written
  to let the fleet steer a Supervisor's process. For a listed one the same keys would let the Server
  deliver a configuration on the command line or in the environment, and the switch would not
  mean what it says.
- **Holding only `args`, `version_args` and `env` of a listed Supervisor's block to the running
  block.** It closes the command line and the environment and leaves every other key to the bounds
  of clauses 38 and 39. An `icinga2` block's `parent_host`, `node_name` and `trusted_cert_file` then
  stay deliverable, and with the pin pointed at a file no remote configuration writes, the agent
  enrols on trust on first use with a parent the Server chose. Any such list has to be kept current
  with every kind, and equality needs no list.
- **Letting an added listed block carry kind settings within the bounds of clauses 38 and 39.** The
  same keys would reach the agent through the block that adds it, before the operator wrote
  anything. An added block carries what names its program, and the operator configures the rest on
  the host.
- **Refusing startup when a listed name matches no block.** A Server that delivers that block later
  is the normal case, and the refusal would stop the whole Client for it.

## Consequences

- Positive: many Supervisors per Client, a Foreign Agent managed like a Collector, a new kind as
  one module, and an extension-carrying Collector visible through its own reporting — with no
  Server change, on the tested `instance_uid` routing.
- Positive: a wrapped agent's block is `type` and `name`, the same two lines on every platform;
  an artifact whose layout moves is one edit in the kind, reaching every host with the next Client
  version; the platform branches are compile-time constants a test can assert.
- Positive: reload-capable agents keep their state across configuration changes; retiring a
  Supervisor undoes what its installation did; a delivered agent never fails for a missing
  directory; a rollout can aim only at Clients carrying the kind.
- Positive: an upstream change surfaces as a red test on the side it touches, with a document
  saying what the other side owes.
- Negative / trade-offs: losing the one upstream connection affects every Agent riding it, and a
  reconnect resends full state per Agent. An ephemeral Endpoint port cannot serve an
  extension-carrying Collector; the operator pins it.
- Negative / trade-offs: `APPLIED` means "restarted and survived the grace", not "validated"; a
  process that accepts a configuration and fails later surfaces as unhealthy. A reload leaves less
  evidence than a restart, so an adapter that cannot verify its reload says so in its outcome.
- Negative / trade-offs: supporting a new agent well costs a wrapper, a document and two tests;
  `command` keeps "not yet wrapped" usable, but such an agent applies by restart and runs in its
  program's directory. Kind-specific installs carry their own rollback burden.
- Negative / trade-offs: an Agent cannot be tagged per block before its first message; a label
  covers it from the first exchange on. One attribute per kind reads worse than a list.
- Negative / trade-offs: a kind is coupled to one artifact's shape — "bring your own tree" is a
  packaging question, not a configuration one. The documents' prose has no test behind it.
- Follow-ups (by topic): extension-configuration injection; plain-HTTP polling on the Endpoint;
  connection pools and their failure semantics; a verified-reload gate and making reload vs restart
  visible upstream; kinds that install through OS package managers; the kinds in
  `AvailableComponents` once it leaves *Development*; the next wrapped agent (Fluent Bit is the
  documented candidate); a machine-readable artifact manifest if wrapped agents multiply.
- Positive: an update writes only inside a directory the Client owns — no root, no permissions on
  a system `bin`, no `.rollback` files beside system binaries — and hardening can grant write
  access to exactly one tree. `supervisor_dir` takes programs off a `noexec` or undersized `/var`.
- Positive: one kind of Managed Process. Every package feature has one case, and a capability can
  never depend on how a path was spelled; a locally written block and a delivered one describe the
  same thing.
- Positive: a Foreign Agent's configuration path follows a relocated root or a rename.
- Positive: Supervisors are fleet-manageable end to end with the same rollout and Selector scoping
  as every Configuration; unchanged Supervisors ride through an apply; a delivered set can only run
  programs that arrive as verified packages.
- Positive: a removal is complete — no program-sized leftovers, no stale identity.
- Negative / trade-offs: a program installed by the machine cannot be supervised; adopting a host
  that already runs a vendor agent means a repack and a package rollout before the Agent appears.
- Negative / trade-offs: one copy of a program per Supervisor; an archive artifact is still written
  twice (unpacked), so the rename saving lands on bare-binary artifacts.
- Negative / trade-offs: an unknown placeholder passes through rather than failing, unlike an
  unknown key; an absolute path in an argument still works and can still drift.
- Negative / trade-offs: after the first applied offer, while the Server manages the set, a local
  edit to the blocks drifts silently until the next publication overwrites it.
- Negative / trade-offs: removal is destructive and final; a Supervisor removed by a mis-scoped
  rollout loses its identity and its program. A crash between write and purge leaves an orphan
  only a human removes.
- Positive: an operator can stop the Server from adding, changing or purging Supervisors on a
  host with one line the Server does not write (Q-1); with `remote_config_disabled`, a listed
  agent can no longer reach the Server's configuration under another name, which closes on a host
  that sets both what the list alone leaves open.
- Negative / trade-offs: the line holds against the Server only while every Supervisor whose
  configuration language can run commands as the Client's account is in
  `remote_config_disabled`, and a signed Client build can still replace the program that reads it
  where `[self_update]` consents (clause 46).
- Positive: the switch needs no change on the Server, and the fleet view shows it through the
  Client's capability set, which lacks `AcceptsRemoteConfig`.
- Negative / trade-offs: a host that keeps its set is managed by hand. A Supervisor set released
  to it reaches nothing, and G-1's loop does not close for the Client's own Agent there by
  design.
- Negative / trade-offs: the blocks an earlier set wrote stay in force without notice when the
  switch goes off; the operator has to review them, and the manual says so. Switching back on
  replaces the operator's blocks with the first applied set.
- Positive: an operator can close the configuration channel for one agent with one line the
  Server cannot change. A compromised Server can then no longer write that agent's configuration
  or run what its configuration language allows (Q-1). Signed package updates still reach it.
- Positive: switching remote configuration off for a Supervisor needs no change on the Server, and
  the fleet view shows why: the Agent's capability set lacks `AcceptsRemoteConfig`, and the Server
  offers it nothing however a rollout is aimed.
- Positive: switching off takes the Server's last configuration out of force at the next start
  without destroying what the operator put in its place.
- Negative / trade-offs: a listed Supervisor is configured by hand on its host. A rollout aimed at
  it releases nothing it receives, and G-1's loop does not close for that Agent by design.
- Negative / trade-offs: `remote_config_disabled` binds a name, not an agent. While the Server
  still manages the set it can remove a listed Supervisor and add the same agent under a name that
  is not listed. That Agent is new, installed afresh from a signed package and visible as such in
  the fleet, but its configuration is the Server's; `server_manages_set = false` closes that.
- Negative / trade-offs: a change to either key takes effect at the next start of the Client, like
  every other key of the file.
- Negative / trade-offs: the per-Agent capability set is no longer the same on every host, for the
  Client's own Agent, or for every Supervisor. [`CONFORMANCE.md`](../CONFORMANCE.md) rows for
  `AcceptsRemoteConfig` and `ReportsRemoteConfig` must say they can be withdrawn, for the Client's
  own Agent and per Supervisor (G-12).
- Negative / trade-offs: a Server that manages the set must deliver a listed block exactly as it
  runs. A change the operator makes to it on the host has to reach the Server's copy before the
  next delivered set, or that set fails.
- Follow-ups (by topic): startup reconciliation of a locally edited set; a bundled-UI editor for
  Supervisor sets; an opt-in reap of orphaned directories; a purge option on `service uninstall`;
  pruning stale `.rollback` files on a schedule; a supervise-only mode as its own decision; keeping
  chosen blocks from the Server while it manages the rest; showing in the fleet view that a host
  keeps its set; reporting a listed Supervisor's local files as its effective configuration when
  its process reports none; whether an `icinga2` Agent should refuse to enrol on trust on first use
  when its block names a `trusted_cert_file` that does not exist, rather than fall back to `pki
  save-cert` (ADR-0034), which is not decided here; storing an offer so that a stop part-way leaves
  no file the drop of clause 52 cannot attribute.

- The switch per Supervisor (clauses 48 to 55):
  - `crates/fleet-agent/src/config.rs`:
    `remote_config_disabled_defaults_to_empty_and_lists_supervisor_names` (clause 48),
    `a_remote_config_disabled_name_outside_the_instance_name_grammar_fails_startup` (clause 49).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/agent.rs`:
    `a_supervisor_with_remote_config_disabled_declares_neither_remote_config_capability` (clause
    50: the report's `capabilities` lack both bits and keep `ReportsEffectiveConfig`,
    `AcceptsRestartCommand` and the package bits),
    `a_remote_config_offered_anyway_is_neither_stored_nor_applied_nor_reported` (clause 51: no
    `remote-config.pb`, no entry file, no pending apply, no `remote_config_status` in the next
    report), `an_ignored_remote_config_is_logged_once_per_hash` (clause 51).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/mod.rs`:
    `a_listed_name_without_a_block_is_a_notice_not_a_refusal` (clause 49),
    `a_listed_supervisor_drops_the_stored_remote_config_and_keeps_the_operators_files` (clause 52:
    unchanged entries and `.supplementary` deleted, an overwritten entry and an operator's extra
    file kept, `remote-config.pb` gone, before the kind starts),
    `an_undecodable_stored_remote_config_is_deleted_and_config_is_left_alone` (clause 52),
    `a_listed_supervisor_reports_no_remote_config_status_after_a_restart` (clause 52),
    `the_clients_own_agent_keeps_accepting_its_supervisor_set_when_its_name_is_listed` (clause 49).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/src/reconfigure.rs`:
    `a_delivered_set_cannot_switch_remote_config_back_on_for_a_listed_name` (clause 48: a set that
    removes and re-adds the listed block leaves the started Agent without `AcceptsRemoteConfig`, and
    the written file keeps `[supervisors]` byte for byte),
    `a_delivered_block_for_a_listed_supervisor_must_equal_the_running_block_whole` (clause 54: with
    `delivered_args = true` and `delivered_env = ["*"]`, a delivered block for a listed name that
    changes `args`, `version_args`, an `env` entry or a core key, adds a key or drops one fails the
    offer naming the block and the key; the running block delivered back passes),
    `a_listed_icinga2_keeps_the_parent_and_the_pin_the_operator_wrote` (clause 54: a delivered
    `icinga2` block for a listed name that changes `parent_host` or `node_name`, or points
    `trusted_cert_file` at a missing file in `${config_dir}`, fails the offer naming the key),
    `an_added_listed_supervisor_carries_only_what_names_its_program` (clause 54: with no running
    block, `type`, `name` and `binary` for a `collector`, `command` for a `command`, and nothing else
    for an `icinga2` pass; any further key, an empty `args` or an `icinga2` `parent_host` among
    them, fails the offer naming it).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/src/storage.rs`:
    `a_store_cut_short_leaves_no_previous_entry_file_beside_a_new_pb` (clause 52: a store cut short
    while it writes the new entry files leaves the previous `remote-config.pb` beside no previous
    entry file, so nothing of the previous offer stays unattributed).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/tests/supervisor.rs`:
    `a_listed_collector_runs_on_the_entries_the_operator_placed` (clause 53).
  - `crates/fleet-agent/tests/e2e.rs`:
    `a_server_offers_no_configuration_to_a_listed_supervisor` (clauses 50 and 55: a released
    Configuration reaches the unlisted Supervisor and not the listed one over the same connection).
