# ADR-0063: The Server keeps an append-only audit record of every security decision, each entry chained to the one before by its hash

- **Status:** 🟢 accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-06
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** the audit port in `crates/fleet-server/src/audit.rs`, its writer in `crates/fleet-server/src/audit_log.rs` and its filesystem adapter, every place in `crates/fleet-server/src/` that admits or refuses a peer, issues or revokes a certificate, takes an operator's act or records a package outcome, the `[audit]` section of `server.toml`, and the `audit/` directory under `config_dir`
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-0052](0052-an-append-only-audit-record-chained-by-hash.md)

## Context

ADR-0052 recorded, among the Server's security decisions, a fleet credential offered for rotation
and a credential revoked. The Agent plane now admits by client certificate alone
([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)), so there is no fleet credential to
offer, rotate or revoke, and its audit-availability gate no longer has a credential offer to hold
back. This ADR restates ADR-0052 without those events, and clause 6 names certificate issuance where it
named the credential offer, as the Server already gates it; every other clause stands.

Every security measure of the Server decides something about a peer: admission and its refusal
([ADR-0059](0059-admission-by-a-client-certificate-alone.md)), the throttle, an enrolment request
and its approval, a certificate issued or renewed, a revocation and the sessions it ended
([ADR-0065](0065-certificate-revocation-that-follows-renewal-and-reaches-the-gateways.md)), a rollout ([ADR-0045](0045-packages-and-deployments-that-sign-every-package.md)) and a
package outcome an Agent reports. Without a record of their own these leave log lines at best,
mixed with everything else, kept as long as whatever collects the log keeps it, and changeable by
whoever can write the log. None of them is demonstrable afterwards: an investigation cannot say who
was admitted when, who approved a host, or whether a record was removed. Measure H15 of
[`HARDENING.md`](../HARDENING.md) asks for exactly one record per decision, refusals included — the
half that is easy to omit and the half an investigation needs.

The specification puts security before convenience and holds that no vulnerability can be ruled
out (Strategy *Security before convenience*). A record that an intruder on the Server host can
quietly edit is worth little against exactly that intruder; a record whose entries each carry the
hash of the one before at least makes an edit or a removal visible to whoever checks it against a
copy taken earlier.

Two forces bound the design. A refused admission is the cheapest thing a remote peer can cause, so
a record per refusal must not let a flood fill the disk. And the record must not leak what it
records: no secret, no key, no CSR body. The Agent plane reads no `Authorization` header, but a
Client of an older version may still send one, and an operator signing in to the Operator plane
presents a password; neither may reach the record.

## Decision

We will append one JSON object per security decision to an owner-only audit file under
`config_dir/audit/`, each carrying the SHA-256 of the entry before it, emit the same entry as a
`tracing` event with the target `audit`, and bound the file by size and the refusals by
aggregation.

1. **One entry per decision, refusals included.** An entry is written for:
   - admission on `/v1/opamp` and on the download route: admitted, refused (which check refused,
     never the presented value), throttled. A WebSocket session and a download are recorded
     every time; a plain-HTTP poll once per peer address and certificate per hour, since a fleet
     polling every few seconds would otherwise crowd everything else out of the record;
   - enrolment: a request queued, approved, rejected; the window opened, or closed by an operator
     or run out, with the number of requests that expired with it;
   - issuance: a certificate signed on enrolment or renewal, with its CA role and serial, the
     predecessor, and the `instance_uid` of the request; a CSR refused, with the reason;
   - revocation: a certificate revoked or lifted, and each session it ended; a member refused the
     Gateways' revocation list because its host is not marked as a Gateway, with that host;
   - operator acts: every mutating route of the REST API, with the operator's user name and the
     route, once before it runs and once with its status after; what a revocation, an approval,
     a rejection or a window act did; and every refused or throttled operator sign-in;
   - packages: a rollout, and each package outcome an Agent reports, installed or failed.

2. **What an entry holds.** `seq` (a counter from 1 that never repeats), `time` (RFC 3339, UTC),
   `event` (a fixed name such as `admission.refused`), `outcome`, the peer address, the Agent's
   `instance_uid` where one is known, the presented certificate's CA role and serial where one is
   presented, the operator where one acted, event-specific fields, and `prev` — the SHA-256, hex,
   of the previous entry's line as written. A certificate appears only by role and serial, a CSR
   only by its key fingerprint. No entry holds a secret in any form: an `Authorization` value is
   never written, not even as a hash, whether an operator presented it or an Agent sent it
   unasked. A text field is cut at 256 bytes: a user name or a path can come from a peer that was
   not admitted, and must not be able to fill the record.

3. **The chain.** The first entry of a file carries the hash of the last entry of the file before
   it, or 64 zeros for the first file ever. At startup the Server reads the end of the newest file
   that holds a line, takes `seq` from the last whole entry, and chains on from the last line as it
   stands. A last line that is not a whole entry — a crash mid-write — is kept and closed with a
   newline, and the next entry records `audit.chain_broken`, so a truncation is itself on the
   record and `seq` never repeats. `server audit-verify <dir>` walks every file in order and
   names the first entry whose `prev` does not match.

4. **The file.** `config_dir/audit/audit-<first seq>.jsonl`, the directory `0700` and each file
   `0600` on Unix, under the data root's restricted ACL on Windows. Each entry is one line, written
   with a single append and synced to disk by one writer thread of its own, in the order the
   decisions were taken; a write that fails partway is cut back to the last whole line. A file
   reaching `[audit] max_file_bytes` (default 64 MiB) is closed and a new one opened; the Server
   keeps `[audit] keep_files` files (default 16) and deletes the oldest, recording `audit.rotated`
   with the deleted file's last hash first.

5. **Refusals are aggregated, never dropped.** Within one second, refusals of the same `event`
   from the same peer address — an IPv6 one by its /64, as the throttle counts it — after the
   tenth are counted rather than written, and one `…aggregated` entry with the count follows when
   the second ends. A flood of refusals therefore costs at most ten lines and a count per address
   and second, and every refusal is still accounted for.

6. **Writing never blocks admission on a slow disk, and never silently fails.** Entries go through
   a bounded channel of 10 000 to the writer thread, and a decision goes ahead once its entry is
   queued. When the channel is full, admission and every operator act are refused with `503` and
   no certificate is issued until it drains. When a write fails, the error is logged at `error`,
   and from then on nothing is admitted, no certificate is issued and no operator act runs until a
   write succeeds; the writer retries every second. A CSR held back for want of a record is
   answered `ServerErrorResponse` `Unavailable` with `retry_info`, since the Server, not the
   request, is at fault and the Agent asks again. Decisions that were queued when the write
   failed, or refused for want of a record, are counted, and the next entry that lands carries the
   count as `unrecorded_before`. A security decision is never taken without its record queued, and
   a record that is lost is never lost silently.

7. **The log carries it too.** Every entry is also emitted as a `tracing` event with the target
   `audit`, the same fields, at `info`, so a log collector receives it without reading the file.
   The file is the record; the log is a copy.

**Out of scope:** an audit record on the Client; shipping the record to a remote store or signing
entries with a key; a REST route to read the record; retention by age.

## Alternatives considered

- **Only the normal log, under a target of its own** — retention and integrity would depend on
  whatever collects the log, and a host without a collector keeps nothing an investigation can rely
  on.
- **OTLP logs to a collector** — central, but a Server without a reachable collector loses exactly
  the record an outage investigation needs; it can be added later from the `tracing` copy.
- **Entries without a chain** — simpler, but an edit or a removal is invisible.
- **Signing each entry with a key** — proves more than a chain, but the key would live on the same
  host as the record, so an intruder who can rewrite the file can re-sign it; a chain checked
  against an earlier copy gives most of the value without key management.
- **Dropping refusals under load** — cheaper, but an attack is exactly when refusals matter;
  aggregation keeps the count.
- **An audit record on the Client as well** — a second format to maintain; the Client reports its
  package outcomes to the Server, which records them.

## Consequences

- Positive: an incident becomes an investigation: who was admitted, refused, enrolled, approved,
  issued, revoked and rolled out to, when and by whom, with an edit or a removal visible against an
  earlier copy.
- Negative / trade-offs: a write per decision on the admission path; a disk that stops writing
  stops admission and issuance (clause 6), which is the intended order of failure. The record grows
  with the fleet's traffic and is bounded by size, so a large fleet keeps less time than a small
  one. A record written before this decision may still hold `rotation.offered` entries and
  credential hashes cut to eight hex digits; they stay in the chain as written.
- Follow-ups: shipping the record off the host; reading it through the REST API; an audit record of
  the Client's own decisions.

## Enforcement

- `crates/fleet-server/src/audit_log.rs` tests: `each_entry_carries_the_hash_of_the_one_before`,
  `the_chain_survives_a_restart_and_a_rotation`, `a_truncated_file_is_recorded_as_a_broken_chain`,
  `refusals_beyond_ten_a_second_are_aggregated_with_their_count` (clauses 2, 3, 5),
  `a_write_that_fails_refuses_until_one_succeeds` (clause 6).
- `crates/fleet-server/src/fs/audit.rs` test:
  `the_record_is_owner_only_and_continues_where_it_ended` (clauses 3, 4).
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/mutual_tls.rs` tests:
  `an_admission_and_its_refusal_each_leave_one_entry`, which refuses a revoked certificate,
  `an_issued_certificate_is_recorded_with_its_predecessor`,
  `a_revocation_records_the_sessions_it_ended`, `an_operator_act_names_the_operator`,
  `an_audit_that_cannot_write_refuses_admission` (clauses 1, 6). That no entry holds the
  operator's password is asserted by `an_operator_act_names_the_operator`.
- `crates/fleet-server/tests/mutual_tls.rs`:
  `an_authorization_an_older_client_sends_is_never_written` — an Agent admitted on its certificate
  while sending an `Authorization` header leaves an admission entry that holds neither the value
  nor any hash of it (clause 2); `an_audit_that_cannot_write_issues_no_certificate` — with the
  record unavailable, a CSR on a member connection gets no certificate and is answered
  `Unavailable` with `retry_info` (clause 6); `an_unmarked_member_asking_for_the_list_leaves_a_refusal`
  (clause 1).
- `crates/fleet-server/src/fleet.rs` — `unavailable_tells_the_agent_when_to_retry` (clause 6).
