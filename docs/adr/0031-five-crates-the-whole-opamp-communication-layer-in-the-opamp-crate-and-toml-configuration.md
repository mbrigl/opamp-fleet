# ADR-0031: Five crates in one Cargo workspace on tokio and axum without its WebSocket — the whole OpAMP communication layer in the publishable `opamp` crate reading WebSocket frames itself, an internal shared crate by measurement — and TOML configuration

- **Status:** 🟡 proposed
- **Date:** 2026-10-10
- **Deciders:** Markus Brigl
- **Applies to:** Cargo.toml, `crates/opamp/` (its manifest and `[features]`, `build.rs`, `src/`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `README.md`), crates/fleet-core/, every OpAMP connection and listener of `crates/fleet-server/` and `crates/fleet-agent/` (the Server's two planes, the Client's upstream connection and its verification probe, the Gateway's downstream endpoint and upstream pool, the Supervisor Endpoint), `AgentState` in `crates/fleet-agent/src/supervisor/agent.rs`, the Client's `Session` in `crates/fleet-agent/src/transport/`, crates/fleet-agent/src/lib.rs and main.rs, crates/fleet-tools/, the bundled UI under crates/fleet-server/static/, server.toml and supervisor.toml, the per-feature lint in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `README.md`, and every new crate, module placement or dependency
- **Supersedes:** [ADR-0009](0009-five-crates-the-whole-opamp-communication-layer-in-the-opamp-crate-and-toml-configuration.md)

## Context

The [specification](../SPECIFICATION.md) fixes the language (both ends in Rust) and the deployables:
one Server (Linux only, API-first, with a rudimentary bundled UI) and one Client binary covering every
Client Mode ([ADR-0014](0014-client-modes-and-a-gateway-that-passes-packages-only-to-the-hosts-they-were-offered-to.md)). Everything is async I/O: the Server
holds many long-lived connections, the Client a Connection Pool and supervised processes. The Server
must serve protobuf bodies and WebSocket upgrades on one route set. The Dev Container is lean
([ADR-0002](0002-dev-container-runtime.md)), so a choice that needs OpenSSL headers, cmake or node
carries a real cost, and the UI is explicitly not the product.

The floor on the pace of every request body and every WebSocket message
([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)
clause 14) has to see a message's data frames: judged by the bytes a connection reads, a message
that has begun stays open for ever while its peer sends a Ping between its fragments, which
RFC 6455 allows, and every Ping looks like progress. axum's WebSocket hands over whole messages
only, so `opamp` upgrades the connection itself and reads the frames with the library its client
already uses, and nothing in the workspace uses axum's `ws` feature. And the order of the Client's
flows after a reply matters: with the certificate first, a request queued there rides the next
connection after the offer that answered it, and is signed a second time.

The OpAMP communication is one publishable crate with a `client` and a `server` feature, one
endpoint around a handler for every server surface, and one state machine and two drivers around a
session for an Agent. That is one decision, and every change to the crate touches all three parts.

Stopping at the material a connection is built from — an endpoint that hands out a router and never
a listener, a client that lets the application build the TLS connector, the HTTP client and the
headers — leaves each surface writing its own transport plumbing.

- **Server TLS twice.** `fleet-server/src/tls.rs` and `fleet-agent/src/gateway/mod.rs` each build
  a rustls `ServerConfig` from a certificate, a key and an optional client CA, with the same ALPN
  fix.
- **Listener bounds once.** `fleet-server/src/listen.rs` bounds the header read and the TLS
  handshake ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)). The Gateway's
  downstream listener and the Supervisor Endpoint have neither bound.
- **Client connect three times.** The drivers connect, `connection::verify` connects again to
  prove an offer ([ADR-0013](0013-connection-settings-offered-without-a-credential-and-server-capabilities.md)), and the
  Gateway's upstream pool connects a third time. Each one builds the WebSocket request, the
  `Authorization` header and the TLS connector by hand.
- **The ring provider and the PEM readers.** Both ends install the provider with the same function.
  The PEM readers sit in `fleet-core` only because both ends need them for TLS.

The maintainer wants the whole communication layer in `opamp`, with its configuration added from
outside. Against that stands the argument that TLS and credentials built inside `opamp` are this
project's policy. That reason holds for the policy and not for the mechanism. Which CA to trust, which certificate to present and
which credential to send is policy. Turning those bytes into a rustls configuration, refusing
redirects, marking the header sensitive and bounding a listener is mechanism, and it is the same for
every OpAMP implementation.

Three questions recur once the code exists. **What goes into the shared crates?** A crate boundary
costs what a module boundary does not: every dependency of a shared crate is gained by both ends,
and every change to it recompiles both. Two different things are shared. What the Baseline defines
— the types, the framing, the endpoint's body rules, the attribute keys, and the server and client
sides of the communication — is OpAMP, reusable by anyone, and lives in the publishable `opamp`
crate. What both ends of *this* project implement identically beyond the
protocol — the baked version and its grammar, the PEM readers, the platform aliases — is this
project's own, and lives in an internal crate.
**How does a test reach the Client?** Cargo hands a test a helper binary's path
(`CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>`) only in an integration test, and an integration test links only a
package's library. **Where do operator tools live?** `opamp-fleetctl`, the operator tool
([ADR-0030](0030-the-operator-tools-are-one-program-released-for-linux-and-macos.md)), runs on an
operator's machine and uses a few Client items: the 7z Unix-mode convention, the unpackers, and
the TLS provider helper.

Operators hand-edit both configuration files, often over SSH; a format's failure modes matter more
than its expressiveness. YAML's indentation and implicit typing (`no` → `false`) are classic sources
of silent fleet misconfiguration. The payloads the Server distributes are the Managed Process's own
format and are not affected.

## Decision

We will build one Cargo workspace of five crates (`opamp`, `fleet-core`, `fleet-server`,
`fleet-agent`, `fleet-tools`) on `tokio` and `axum`, make `crates/opamp` the whole OpAMP
communication layer — the wire layer always, and behind `client` and `server` each side's
connection end to end, its TLS and its listener included, built from values the application hands
it and never from a file or a configuration format of its own — keep in `fleet-core` what both ends
implement identically beyond the Baseline, as measured, make the Client a library under a thin
binary, keep the operator tools in their own crate depending on the Client, and configure both
binaries from strict TOML files.

1. **The wire layer, without features.** `proto` (generated from the vendored Baseline schema with
   protox, [ADR-0010](0010-the-protocol-is-pinned-and-checked-against-opamp-go-on-the-endpoint-as-it-ships.md)), `frame`, `endpoint`, `uid`,
   `attributes` and `BASELINE`. They depend on `prost`, `uuid` and `flate2` only.

2. **One publishable crate, versioned by the Baseline.** `publish = true` for `opamp` alone, with
   its metadata and opamp-spec's licence beside the schema. The `MAJOR.MINOR` is the Baseline's,
   the patch number is the crate's own, and a breaking change waits for the next Baseline. The first
   `cargo publish` is the maintainer's decision.

3. **Two features, neither on by default, each linted alone.** `client` adds `tokio`, `tracing`,
   `ring`, `tokio-tungstenite`, `futures-util`, `reqwest`, `rustls` and `webpki-roots`. `server`
   adds `tokio`, `tracing`, `axum`, `axum-server`, `hyper`, `hyper-util`, `tokio-tungstenite`,
   `futures-util` and `rustls`. `hyper` is named for its upgrade, which axum carries anyway;
   `tokio-tungstenite` is the client's own WebSocket library, so both sides frame alike. The lint runs with no
   feature, with `client` and with `server`. docs.rs builds with all features.

4. **`opamp::tls` is the TLS both sides share,** compiled with either feature. It installs the ring
   provider, never a system library ([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)).
   It reads certificates and a private key from PEM bytes, and an empty result is an error. It
   carries an `Identity`, a certificate chain and its key as PEM. It opens no file. Every rustls
   configuration either side builds speaks TLS 1.3 alone, with the three TLS 1.3 suites of the ring
   provider. The process-wide provider carries those suites and no other, so a TLS stack that
   builds its own configuration, such as `reqwest`'s, cannot negotiate TLS 1.2 either. The
   `wss://` connector is always built here, never left to the WebSocket library, so TLS 1.3 holds
   even in an application that never installed the provider. This is the specification's floor
   (Q-3), not a setting the application can lower.

5. **The server endpoint.** `opamp::server` serves both transports on one path, with the media type,
   gzip, the limit in both directions, framing, the 1009 close and the per-connection loop. The
   application implements `Handler`: `on_connecting`, `on_message`, `outbound`, `on_outbound`,
   `on_unreadable` and `on_closed`. `router` returns an axum `Router`. The application may add
   routes and admission layers to it. The WebSocket upgrade is an axum route that answers the
   handshake and takes the connection through hyper's upgrade; `opamp` frames it with
   `tokio-tungstenite` over a reader that follows the frame headers as they arrive, so it knows
   whether a data message has begun and how much of it has come, apart from the control frames
   between its fragments (ADR-0012 clause 14).

6. **The server listener.** `opamp::server::listen` builds the rustls `ServerConfig` from a
   certificate, a key and a client-certificate rule: none, optional or required against a CA. It
   sets the ALPN protocols. `serve` runs a router on a bound listener with the bounds of ADR-0012:
   a 30-second header read with the timer it needs, and a 10-second TLS handshake. It puts the
   verified peer certificate and the peer address into every request, on every listener it serves.
   A handle shuts listeners down, and one handle may drain several. How long a drain may take is
   the application's to state. `serve` refuses to listen without TLS on any address but the
   loopback literals `127.0.0.1` and `::1` (Q-1). Every OpAMP listener of this project serves through it. Those are
   the Server's two planes, the Gateway's downstream endpoint and the Supervisor Endpoint.

7. **The client state machine and its session.** `opamp::client::protocol` decides which fields a
   report carries and what a reply means, and depends on nothing but `opamp` and the standard
   library. The application implements `Session` for one connection carrying any number of Agents:
   `connected`, `routine`, `owed`, `on_reply`, `after_reply`, `changed`, `exchange_failed`, `stop`
   and `goodbyes`. `AfterReply`, `Ended`, `ReportSink`, `StopSignal` and `Backoff` are public.

8. **The client connection.** The application describes a connection as `opamp::client::Connection`:
   the endpoint, the `Authorization` value, the trust anchors and the identity as PEM, the message
   limit, the heartbeat and the poll interval. `opamp::client` builds everything from that
   description. It picks the transport by scheme. It builds the rustls configuration for `wss://`
   and the HTTP client for `https://`, which follows no redirect, times out after 30 seconds and
   marks the credential sensitive. It refuses `ws://` and `http://` to any host but the loopback
   literals `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, before it connects (Q-1). A host name is never loopback, not
   even `localhost`, because a name can be made to resolve anywhere. The same description drives the
   connection, the one-shot probe that proves offered settings (ADR-0013), and a single WebSocket
   for a caller that drives its own socket, such as the Gateway's upstream pool.

9. **What stays with the application is the policy and its sources.** The application decides
   which files hold the material, which identity is in force, which credential is sent and when it
   rotates. It parses `server.toml` and `supervisor.toml`. It persists and merges connection
   settings (ADR-0013). It runs the CSR flow and the CA, and it decides admission (ADR-0022). Its
   `AgentState` keeps the Client's decisions over one protocol state machine. Its flows after a
   reply run in one order: connection settings, certificate, packages, the self-update restart, the
   Supervisor set ([ADR-0020](0020-the-client-updates-itself-from-a-signed-package.md)). Connection settings come before
   the certificate because an offer may carry the certificate a request asked for, and a request
   queued before it is taken in would ride the next connection and be signed again.

10. **Behaviour stays, with these deliberate exceptions.** The suites of the three surfaces and of
    the Client run unchanged on the moved code. The exceptions follow from one listener and one
    connect serving every surface:
    - The Gateway's downstream listener and the Supervisor Endpoint gain the header-read and
      handshake bounds that only the Server had.
    - A plaintext Gateway drains for a bounded time on shutdown, as a TLS one already did.
    - The Operator plane and the plain listeners carry the peer address and the peer certificate
      into their requests too. Nothing there reads them.
    - The probe of offered settings applies the message limit and marks the credential sensitive,
      as the long-running connection does.
    - TLS 1.2 is no longer offered or accepted by either end, and plaintext off the loopback is
      refused rather than warned about (clauses 4, 6 and 8).

11. **One workspace, five crates, one lockfile, one toolchain.** `crates/opamp` (the publishable
    communication layer), `crates/fleet-core` (the internal shared crate), `crates/fleet-server`,
    `crates/fleet-agent` and `crates/fleet-tools`. Versions are pinned once in
    `[workspace.dependencies]`; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the compiler. Every crate but `opamp` is
    `publish = false`. A further crate needs a concrete need a module cannot meet (compile time,
    reuse, a dependency boundary); hexagonal seams live as modules first.

12. **`tokio` and `tracing`.** The multi-threaded `tokio` runtime on both ends; `tracing` with
    `tracing-subscriber` for structured logging; `serde` for the REST API's JSON and for configuration
    files.

13. **`axum` is the workspace's HTTP server stack.** The Server's OpAMP endpoint, REST API and UI are
    axum routes in one router, upgrades included: the OpAMP endpoint's upgrade is an axum route
    whose connection `opamp` takes over through hyper (clause 5), so axum's `ws` feature is off; the OpAMP
    endpoint of the Server, the Gateway and the Supervisor Endpoint is `opamp::server`'s, and so is
    the listener it is served on (clauses 5 and 6). Which listeners exist is
    [ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)'s.

14. **The bundled UI is static assets embedded in the Server binary.** Plain HTML, CSS and JS under
    `crates/fleet-server/static/`, embedded with `include_str!`; no frontend toolchain. The REST API is the
    contract, and the UI is one client of it.

15. **CI enforces the Definition of Done on this stack.** `cargo build`, `cargo test`,
    `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` with warnings denied on Linux; the Client is also checked
    and tested on Windows and macOS, and release-built on all three; the Server is built on Linux only.

16. **The internal shared crate holds what both ends implement identically, established by
    measurement.** Code enters `fleet-core` when both ends implement it identically, or would have
    to, and the Baseline does not define it — what it defines goes to `opamp` (clause 17). Adding it
    is ordinary work under this clause. Nothing enters to make the crate look less small. Each
    addition is judged by what it costs the two ends; a build dependency is the cheaper case, since
    it links into no artifact.

17. **What goes where.**
    - `opamp`, always: `proto` and `frame`, the generated types and the WebSocket framing
      ([ADR-0010](0010-the-protocol-is-pinned-and-checked-against-opamp-go-on-the-endpoint-as-it-ships.md)); `uid`, the `instance_uid` type;
      `attributes`, constants for the Baseline keys this project matches on (`SERVICE_NAME`,
      `SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME`, `SERVICE_NAMESPACE`, `SERVICE_VERSION`, `OS_TYPE`, `OS_DESCRIPTION`,
      `HOST_ARCH`) and the accessors over them, where `string_value` states once that an empty string
      is not a value; `endpoint`, with `OPAMP_PATH` (`/v1/opamp`), `PROTOBUF_CONTENT_TYPE`,
      `is_protobuf`, and `decode_body`, which applies the Baseline's gzip MUST with the size limit
      enforced *after* decompression and whose `BodyError` separates unsupported encoding,
      undecodable gzip and too large.
    - `opamp`, behind its features (clauses 3–8): the server endpoint and its listener, an Agent's
      protocol state machine and connection, and `tls` with the PEM readers `certificates` and
      `private_key`. Their path-based wrappers and error wording stay in each end, where what the
      file means is known.
    - `fleet-core`: `version`, the version helper
      ([ADR-0011](0011-versions-resolved-in-the-internal-crate.md)); `platform`, the platform alias
      table ([ADR-0037](0037-packages-signed-deployments-offered-downloads-and-verified-delivery.md)).

18. **What the measurement leaves where it is.** The Server's router and admission, the Server's CA,
    the Client's CSR flow, the persistence of its connection settings, the choice of which TLS and
    credential material each end hands `opamp`, and the Server's `attr_map` (a decision about the
    REST view). Each exists once. A later measurement that finds one written twice moves it under
    clause 16.

19. **The Client is a library with a thin binary on top.** `crates/fleet-agent/src/lib.rs` declares the
    module tree; `src/main.rs` keeps only what starting a process needs: parsing the command line,
    handing off to the daemon or the `service` verbs, and the exit code.

20. **Visibility is widened by need.** An item becomes `pub` when a test or another workspace target
    has to reach it. `pub` in the Client means "another target here reaches it", not a published
    interface. Where widening would expose an invariant only the module can hold, the item stays
    private and the test moves to where it can see it.

21. **Tests reach what they test through the library.** Integration tests import constants rather
    than restating them, and tests that spawn a real program spawn the Client's own cross-platform
    stubs (`stub_agent`, `stub_crasher`, under `crates/fleet-agent/src/bin/`) instead of a shell, so they
    run on all three platforms. A `#[cfg(unix)]` gate sits only on what is genuinely a Unix fact,
    such as a file mode. The stubs stay in `fleet-agent`, because `CARGO_BIN_EXE_*` resolves only inside
    the crate that declares them.

22. **The operator tool is its own crate, depending on the Client.**
    `crates/fleet-tools` produces `opamp-fleetctl` (ADR-0030) and has no library.
    The arrow points one way: `fleet-tools` uses `fleet_agent::archive`, `opamp::tls` and the
    reading of a certificate's end in `fleet-core` that the Server shares (ADR-0029) rather than
    restating them, and its tests open what the tool produces with the Client's own unpacker. Nothing
    in `fleet-agent`, `fleet-server` or `opamp` depends on `fleet-tools`. Tool-only dependencies (the 7z
    writer, release listing) are declared there, so `cargo build -p fleet-agent` does not build them,
    and so is the code that makes the fleet's certificate authorities, which no end runs.

23. **Both binaries are configured from TOML.** `server.toml` and `supervisor.toml`, parsed with the
    `toml` crate into `serde` structs. Each binary takes the path from `--config`, defaulting to the
    file of that name in the working directory, and runs on defaults when the file does not exist.
    The file is the whole configuration: no setting is read from the environment (`RUST_LOG`
    filters log output and configures nothing else).

24. **A configuration that does not parse fails startup, loudly.** Every setting has a documented
    default; unknown keys are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`, or the equivalent strict parse for a
    `[[supervisor]]` block's kind-specific keys), and an invalid value or half-written setting is an
    error naming it. The same holds for files a binary reads at startup to restore its state: one
    that does not parse fails startup rather than being skipped or silently defaulted.

**Out of scope:** the CSR flow and the Server's CA, which stay in the application with ADR-0022;
finer features, such as one per transport; a release routine for the crate; where the PEM
material comes from on disk; where an installed service looks for its configuration file on each OS
([ADR-0035](0035-the-client-supervisor-installed-service-releases-and-installers.md)); the listener layout
([ADR-0012](0012-tls-1-3-plaintext-on-the-loopback-alone-and-bounded-planes-bodies-and-messages.md)); whether a release ships the operator
tools.

## Alternatives considered

- **axum's WebSocket, judged by the bytes the connection reads.** A Ping between two fragments of
  a message looks like progress, so a message stays open for ever; treating control frames as no
  progress closes a peer that only pings. TLS records and the bytes read with the upgrade request
  blur the count too.
- **Parsing the frames below hyper, in the listener's stream.** Below TLS the bytes are encrypted;
  above it, hyper reads ahead of the upgrade request and the parser would have to follow every
  HTTP/1 request on the connection to find where the frames begin.
- **A residual written down instead.** The floor would hold for bodies and not for the transport
  that carries the fleet.
- **Keep the material with the application.** Rejected: three surfaces write
  the same connect, and two listeners lack the bounds the third has. The policy argument is met by
  clause 9, which keeps every decision about the material with the application.
- **Let `opamp` read the files and the TOML sections itself.** Rejected: a published crate would
  impose this project's file layout and configuration format on every user, and a test would need
  files where it now passes bytes.
- **The choice of TLS material and credential in `opamp`.** That choice is this project's policy,
  not the protocol, so each end makes it and hands `opamp` the result (clause 9).
- **Hand `reqwest` a prebuilt rustls configuration**, so that one configuration serves both
  transports. Not chosen: `tls_backend_preconfigured` is documented without semver stability and
  breaks silently on a version mismatch. The PEM bytes feed `reqwest`'s own builder instead.
- **Move the CSR flow into `opamp` too.** Not chosen now: OpAMP carries the CSR, but generating a
  key and signing a request is certificate policy, and it would add `rcgen` to the published crate.
  It can follow once a second user wants it.
- **Separate crates per side, or `client` and `server` on by default.** Rejected:
  the sides share a version and break together, and a types-only user would pull both dependency
  sets.
- **Depend on an existing crate.** None fits: `otel-opamp-rs` follows a 2023 draft and is dormant,
  and `newrelic-opamp-rs` is licensed for New Relic's service only.
- **`actix-web`.** Its own runtime flavour and actor heritage; axum is plain `tokio` and `tower`, and
  is where the OpenTelemetry Rust ecosystem sits.
- **Raw `hyper`.** We would hand-write routing, upgrades and extractors that axum provides as a thin
  layer over hyper anyway.
- **A frontend framework and bundler for the UI.** A node toolchain in the Dev Container and CI is a
  large standing cost for a page the specification caps at rudimentary.
- **One shared crate for the protocol and this project's own code.** The git build step and the
  version grammar would sit in a crate others build from a registry, outside any checkout
  (clause 2).
- **Resolving the stub from the test binary's directory.** The suite would pass or fail depending on
  the command that ran it.
- **Moving the supervision core into its own crate for testability.** A library target meets the need
  without turning every internal seam into a crate API.
- **Operator tools inside `fleet-agent`, or `archive` moved into `opamp`.** The first keeps tooling in the
  crate that runs on every managed host; the second widens the shared crate with something only the
  Client implements, since the Server never opens an artifact.
- **A separate repository for the tools, or duplicated items.** The tools' correctness is defined by
  what the Client can install, and `unix_mode_attributes` must have one definition.
- **YAML.** The OpenTelemetry ecosystem's format, but with indentation and implicit-typing failure
  modes in hand-edited files, and `serde_yaml` is unmaintained.
- **JSON, or environment variables and flags only.** JSON has no comments; flags cannot carry the
  Client's per-Supervisor structure, and a file is what an installer lays down and an operator diffs.

## Sources / Prior art

- [`opamp-go`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opamp-go): `server.Start` beside `server.Attach`,
  where `StartSettings` carry the listen address and a `tls.Config`; `client.StartSettings` carry
  the endpoint, the header and a `tls.Config`, and the client builds its HTTP and WebSocket
  connections from them. Read 2026-10-01. `protobufs`, `protobufshelpers` and `internal`
  (`wsmessage.go`, `limits.go`) shared; the WebSocket and HTTP machinery inside `client` and
  `server`.
- [`reqwest::ClientBuilder`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.13/reqwest/struct.ClientBuilder.html):
  `tls_certs_only`, `identity` and `tls_backend_preconfigured`, with the stability warning on the
  last. Read 2026-10-03 in the vendored 0.13.5 source.
- [`axum-server`](https://docs.rs/axum-server/0.7) `RustlsAcceptor::handshake_timeout` and

- [`rustls-pki-types`](https://docs.rs/rustls-pki-types) `PemObject`, the PEM reader rustls itself
  uses.
- hyper and tonic features, the sans-IO pattern, `quinn` over `quinn-proto`, and the Cargo book on
  publishing and feature unification.
- [`axum`](https://docs.rs/axum/0.8) and [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs/) — the router with built-in
  WebSocket upgrade, and the de-facto async runtime.
- [Bindplane](https://bindplane.com/) — the look-and-feel reference for the bundled UI (fleet table,
  status chips, config drawer).
- [The Cargo Book, environment variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html)
  — `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` is set only for integration tests and benchmarks, which build the
  package's binaries automatically; [Cargo targets](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html)
  — integration tests and binaries use the package's library;
  [workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html) and
  [RFC 2906](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2906-cargo-workspace-deduplicate.html) — one lockfile,
  one resolved version per dependency.
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) — a library with a thin `main.rs`; `kubectl`
  beside `kubelet` — an operator tool built with the system it drives but not run on a node.
- [TOML v1.0](https://toml.io/), the [`toml` crate](https://crates.io/crates/toml), and the
  [`serde_yaml` deprecation notice](https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-yaml);
  [`opampsupervisor` configuration](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/cmd/opampsupervisor/specification/README.md)
  — the YAML prior art not followed for this project's own files.

## Consequences

- Positive: a Rust OpAMP implementer gets a working client or server, TLS included, from one
  dependency and a few values. This project's three surfaces share the connect, the listener and
  the bounds, so a fix lands once.
- Positive: `fleet-core` no longer links `rustls`; it holds the version and the platform aliases.
- Positive: one lockfile and one toolchain, and both ends share `opamp`, so they cannot drift on the
  wire types, the Baseline's fixed strings, the gzip rule, or the communication around them. A misspelt attribute key is a compile
  error rather than a silent mis-targeting.
- Positive: the Server is one binary embedding its UI. The operations that write to a host (binary
  swap, health gate, rollback, tree install) are tested on all three platforms.
- Positive: `crates/fleet-agent` is what runs on a managed host, and its manifest says so.
- Negative / trade-offs: the published API grows by `Connection`, the listener and the TLS types.
  `axum-server`'s `Handle` and `tokio-tungstenite`'s socket become part of it, so a breaking bump
  of either waits for the next Baseline.
- Negative / trade-offs: the `server` feature pulls `axum-server` and `hyper-util`, and `client`
  pulls `webpki-roots`. A user who brings their own listener pays for one anyway.
- Negative / trade-offs: the listener attaches the per-connection extensions with `Router::layer`,
  which rebuilds the route table once per accepted connection. It costs more on a listener with
  many routes, such as the Operator plane, and is unmeasured.
- Negative / trade-offs: `tokio` and axum are a deep commitment; reversing them touches every I/O
  boundary. A UI change needs a Server rebuild.
- Negative / trade-offs: every dependency of `opamp` or `fleet-core` recompiles both ends. `endpoint` being
  framework-free means each caller writes its own mapping from `BodyError` to a status code.
- Negative / trade-offs: `pub` inside the Client does not mean "interface", and the compiler does
  not warn about a `pub` item nothing uses.
- Negative / trade-offs: operators coming from OpenTelemetry meet a second format for the fleet
  tooling itself.
- Follow-ups: the CSR flow in `opamp` if a second user wants it; finer features if a user asks for
  one transport alone; a shared test-support target if two suites want the same helpers;
  environment-variable overrides if containerised deployments need them.

## Enforcement

- `crates/opamp/src/lib.rs` `the_crate_version_is_the_baselines` fails when the crate's
  `MAJOR.MINOR` and `opamp::BASELINE` disagree (clause 2).
- `cargo publish --dry-run -p opamp` builds from the packaged sources outside any checkout, and
  [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) lints `opamp` with no feature,
  with `client` and with `server` (clauses 1–3).
- `crates/opamp/src/tls.rs` tests that an empty or foreign PEM is an error and a bundle keeps its
  order (clause 4).
- `crates/opamp/tests/server_endpoint.rs` drives the endpoint over both transports (clause 5);
  `crates/opamp/tests/server_listen.rs` holds a message whose fragments are interleaved with Pings
  to the floor, and leaves a peer that only pings open (clause 5).
- `crates/fleet-agent/tests/enrolment_e2e.rs` issues one certificate per enrolment and per renewal
  (clause 9).
- `crates/opamp/tests/server_listen.rs` proves the header-read bound, the required and the optional
  client certificate, and the peer certificate in the request (clause 6).
- `crates/opamp/src/client/protocol.rs`, `ws.rs`, `http.rs` and `backoff.rs` keep the client-side
  MUSTs under test (clause 7). `crates/opamp/src/client/connection.rs` tests the scheme choice and
  the cleartext rule, and `crates/opamp/tests/client_connection.rs` the probe on both transports,
  the redirect refusal and a run (clause 8).
- The structural test `crates/fleet-core/tests/dependency_direction.rs` lists every module. The
  application suites run unchanged on the moved code (clauses 9, 10).
- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml): `build-test-lint` (clause 15),
  `client-platform-check` on Windows and macOS, and `release-build` (clauses 15, 21). The workspace
  manifest lists the five members, and Cargo refuses a dependency cycle, so `fleet-agent` cannot come to
  depend on `fleet-tools` (clause 22).
- [`crates/fleet-agent/tests/supervisor_process.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/tests/supervisor_process.rs)
  spawns `stub_agent` through `CARGO_BIN_EXE_stub_agent`, and
  [`crates/fleet-agent/tests/self_update_e2e.rs`](../../crates/fleet-agent/tests/self_update_e2e.rs) imports
  `fleet_agent::update::EXIT_RESTART_FOR_UPDATE` (clauses 19, 21).
- `crates/opamp/src/attributes.rs` `an_empty_string_is_not_a_value`;
  `crates/opamp/src/endpoint.rs` `a_gzip_bomb_buys_no_more_memory_than_a_plain_body_would`,
  `what_is_not_gzip_under_a_gzip_header_is_refused`,
  `an_encoding_this_endpoint_does_not_implement_names_itself`; `crates/opamp/src/tls.rs`
  `a_file_holding_no_certificate_is_an_error` (clause 17).
- `crates/fleet-server/src/config.rs` `rejects_unknown_keys` and `crates/fleet-agent/src/config.rs`
  `rejects_an_unknown_scheme_and_unknown_keys` (clause 24).

**Not mechanically decidable:** whether a piece of code is implemented identically by both ends
(clauses 16, 18), and whether a widened item is needed (clause 20), are judgements made in review.
