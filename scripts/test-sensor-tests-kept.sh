# Each case builds a throwaway git repository under a temporary directory with a base commit
# holding two test files and one source file, applies one change as a second commit, runs the
# sensor against the pair, and asserts the exit code and the line the reviewer would read. The
# unchanged repository reports nothing; every other case is one thing the sensor reports, or one
# it must stay silent on.

# Usage:
#     scripts/test-sensor-tests-kept.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
