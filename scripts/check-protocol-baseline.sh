# The Protocol Baseline check (ADR-0010 clause 4, specification G-13): the pinned upstream
# opamp-spec version all protocol code is written against must stay a deliberate choice, so the pin
# is compared with upstream's newest release and a divergence is reported rather than discovered.
#
# - A conformance document without the '<!-- protocol-baseline: vX.Y.Z -->' marker is an error.
# - A newer upstream release is a warning, never an error: upstream tagging a release says nothing
#   about this repository being wrong, and a check that reddened CI for it would be disabled.
# - Without curl or without network the check says so and skips, so the other checks stay usable
#   offline.
#
# The releases list's newest entry is read, not 'releases/latest': opamp-spec marks no release as
# latest, so that endpoint answers 404.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-protocol-baseline.sh [conformance file]
# Prints 'Error: …', 'Warning: …' or 'Note: …' lines. Exit code 1 on an error, 0 otherwise.
