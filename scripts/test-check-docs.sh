# Self-test of scripts/check-docs.sh. Verifies: ADR-0001 ADR-0005 ADR-0008
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository under a temporary directory — a rule file with
# numbered sections, a README with a Project Layout block, the required-checks markers, and the
# Template release line, a workflow and a local runner listing the same check, an ADR record with
# its index, and one skill with its pointer — runs the check against it, and asserts the exit
# code and, for a failing case, the message that names the violation. The baseline passes; every
# other case breaks one thing. The skill pointer check (check 11 of check-docs.sh) is covered in
# every direction; of the older checks, one case each pins the message a maintainer would meet
# first — check 9 gets two more for the toolchain job a derived project adds, checks 12 and 13
# (inherited ADRs decided and the template's identity replaced once the setup file is gone) have
# a case for each of their conditions, and check 14 (the template release named) one for each
# form the line may take.
#
# Section references and ADR numbers inside fixtures are assembled, never written literally, so
# that check-docs.sh does not read this script's own fixtures as references into this repository.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/test-check-docs.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
