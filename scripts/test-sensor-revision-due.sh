# Self-test of scripts/sensor-revision-due.sh. Verifies: ADR-0004
#
# Each case builds a throwaway git repository under a temporary directory with a
# docs/ARCHITECTURE.md carrying the 'Last design revision' line and commits on chosen dates,
# runs the sensor against it, and asserts the exit code and the line a reader would meet. The
# cases cover the count from the first commit and from a date, what is not counted (a docs-only
# commit, a merge), the due message with its directories, and the three ways the line fails to
# read.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/test-sensor-revision-due.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
