# Self-test of scripts/check-protocol-baseline.sh. Verifies: G-13 ADR-0009
#
# A divergence from upstream is detected automatically rather than noticed by chance (G-13): each
# case writes a conformance document with or without the Baseline marker, puts a stub `curl` first
# on PATH that answers with a given releases list or fails, and asserts the exit code and the line
# the check prints. Nothing reaches the network.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/test-check-protocol-baseline.sh
# Exit code 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise.
