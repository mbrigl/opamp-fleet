#
# Runs every consistency check this repository enforces, in one command.
#
# AGENTS.md §5 requires these checks to pass before pushing, and
# .github/workflows/checks.yml runs each of them as a job of its own. This script is the local
# equivalent of that workflow and lists the same checks in the same order — a check added to one
# is added to the other in the same change, or the local gate and CI drift apart and "it passed
# locally" stops meaning anything. Check 9 of check-docs.sh verifies that the two lists,
# and the required status checks named in README.md, still agree.
#
# Every check runs even after an earlier one fails, so a single run reports everything that is
# wrong instead of the first thing. The exit code is what a pre-push decision is made on.
#
# Pure bash + coreutils/git. The individual checks state their own dependencies — the shell lint needs
# ShellCheck and skips itself with a notice where it is missing.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-all.sh        (or: bash scripts/check-all.sh)
# Exit code 0 when every check passes, 1 when any of them fails.
