# Shell lint for this repository.
#
# Runs ShellCheck over every shell script in the repository: every '*.sh' file, and the git hooks
# under .githooks/, which git requires to be named without an extension. The scripts under
# scripts/ and the hooks are the repository's entire enforcement layer, so they are held to a
# lint gate themselves.
#
# ShellCheck is the one check dependency beyond bash + coreutils/find. CI does not install it — the
# GitHub-hosted runner image ships it preinstalled. Locally, when shellcheck is not on PATH, the
# check skips itself with a notice instead of failing (CI remains the enforcing gate); in a CI
# run (CI=true) a missing shellcheck is an error, never a silent skip.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-shell.sh        (or: bash scripts/check-shell.sh)
# Exit code 0 when all scripts pass (or shellcheck is unavailable outside CI), 1 otherwise.
