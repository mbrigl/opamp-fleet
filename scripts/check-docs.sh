# Documentation consistency checks for this repository.
#
# Enforces — as CI, not just convention — the documentation rules from AGENTS.md and
# docs/adr/README.md:
#
#   1. ADR index integrity: every docs/adr/NNNN-*.md file is listed in the index table in
#      docs/adr/README.md, every index row points to an existing file, and the status and the
#      'Applies to' cell shown in the index match the **Status:** and **Applies to:** lines
#      inside each ADR — the index routes a reader from a change to the ADRs that bind it
#      (AGENTS.md, section 2), so a row that misstates what its ADR governs misroutes them.
#      A superseded or rejected row sits below the 'Superseded and rejected' heading and an
#      accepted or proposed one above it: the first table is what a session reads, and a
#      row in the wrong one is either a dead decision read as binding or a binding one
#      never read (docs/adr/README.md).
#   2. ADR numbering integrity: the ADR files run 0001..N without gaps, and every file's
#      '# ADR-NNNN' heading matches its filename (docs/adr/README.md).
#   3. Relative-link integrity: every relative Markdown link in every tracked .md file resolves
#      to a file or directory that exists. Links inside fenced code blocks are illustrations,
#      not claims about files on disk, and are skipped (here and in check 6); so is a target that
#      still carries the 'NNNN' placeholder of docs/adr/template.md; an optional link title
#      ('[text](file "title")') is not part of the path. Reference-style links
#      ('[text][label]') are not resolved — this repository uses inline links only.
#
#      Checks 3 to 6 skip ⚪ superseded and 🔴 rejected ADRs (see is_inactive_adr): both
#      describe a repository state that does not exist, so holding their references against the
#      current tree would demand that it still contain what the project decided against.
#   4. Section-reference integrity: in Markdown, YAML and shell files, every section reference
#      (the section sign followed by a number, e.g. in "AGENTS.md, section 6") matches a numbered
#      '## N.' heading in AGENTS.md — the only numbered document in this repository; extend the
#      check if another one appears. The headings there must themselves run 1..N in order: a
#      gap or a repeat is a botched renumbering, and it is the only half of the renumbering
#      hazard a check can see (AGENTS.md, section 3).
#   5. ADR-reference integrity: every 'ADR-NNNN' reference (with actual digits) names an ADR
#      file that exists in docs/adr/ — anticipated follow-ups are described by topic, never by
#      a number that does not exist yet (docs/adr/README.md).
#   6. ADR link agreement: a Markdown link whose text cites 'ADR-NNNN' points at that ADR's own
#      file — the number and the file it links to must name the same decision
#      (docs/adr/README.md).
#   7. ADR header hygiene: every ADR's '**Status:**' line carries exactly one legend emoji and the
#      word that belongs to it, and no ADR still contains the instruction paragraph from
#      docs/adr/template.md — recognized by a needle read off that template, so rewording it
#      cannot silently disable the check. Check 1 compares index and file emoji-to-emoji, so a
#      leftover list of alternatives and a word contradicting its emoji both survive it — and the
#      word is what a reader believes (docs/adr/README.md).
#   8. Supersession agreement: the '**Supersedes:**' field of the new ADR and the '⚪ superseded by
#      ADR-NNNN' status line of every old one it names — one, or several it consolidates — name
#      each other. Both are written in the same pull request but in two files
#      (docs/adr/README.md), and check 1 cannot see a missing half: it only mirrors the index
#      against whatever status the file carries. Every name of a Supersedes field counts, on
#      whichever line it sits.
#   9. Check-list agreement: the jobs in .github/workflows/checks.yml, the invocations in
#      scripts/check-all.sh, and the required status checks named between the 'required-checks'
#      markers in README.md list the same checks. A check that runs in only one of the three is a
#      gate somebody believes in and does not have, and both files already say in their header
#      that a check added to one is added to the other in the same change (AGENTS.md, section 5).
#      A job of the workflow that runs no script under scripts/ fails too: its commands run in
#      CI and never in the local gate.
#  10. Project Layout integrity: every path listed in the 'Project Layout' block of README.md
#      exists, a trailing '/' meaning a directory. The block is written by hand and nothing else
#      tells a reader that one of its lines has gone stale. The reverse direction is deliberately
#      not checked — the block is a tour of the parts a newcomer needs, not a file listing.
#  11. Skill pointer integrity: every skill under .agents/skills/ (a directory with a SKILL.md)
#      has a symlink of the same name under .claude/skills/ that resolves to it, and every entry
#      under .claude/skills/ is such a symlink (ADR-0005). Claude Code reads only the pointer
#      directory, so a skill without its pointer is invisible to it and to no other agent —
#      nobody notices; a copy instead of a symlink is a second source that drifts, and a skill
#      that lives only in the pointer directory is one no other agent finds. Each message says
#      the command that fixes it. A repository with neither directory has nothing to check.
#  12. Inherited ADRs decided: once TEMPLATE-SETUP.md is gone, no ADR whose '**Deciders:**' field
#      names the NUC maintainer is still 🟡 proposed. Each was accepted, with the project's own
#      maintainer added to Deciders, or superseded (docs/adr/README.md): an inherited ADR nobody
#      accepted is a rule nobody decided, and the test that ADR asks for lands with its
#      acceptance. While the setup file exists the decision is pending by design, and the check
#      is silent.
#  13. Template identity replaced: once TEMPLATE-SETUP.md is gone, none of the template's
#      placeholders is left: the project name NUC in the README title and the Dev Container name,
#      the template's repository in the README badge, the copyright holder in LICENSE, the
#      security contact in SECURITY.md, and a CODEOWNERS with no active rule. Step 1 of the setup
#      replaces each; a placeholder that survives it describes the template, not the project. A
#      file that does not exist has nothing to check.
#  14. Template release named: README.md carries a '**Template release:**' line naming a
#      'vX.Y.Z' tag or 'unreleased' (ADR-0008). Tags do not travel with GitHub's template
#      mechanism, so the line is the one thing that tells a derived project which release of the
#      template it carries; a release moves it, and a project that takes a release up moves it.
#  15. Protocol Baseline currency: the pinned OpAMP specification version in docs/CONFORMANCE.md
#      is compared against the latest upstream release. A divergence is a *warning*, never an
#      error — an upstream release is not a defect in this repository, and failing here would
#      turn CI red for something outside it. Requires network; silently skipped without one, so
#      every other check stays usable offline. It concerns this repository only, so it does not
#      run against a fixture root passed by scripts/test-check-docs.sh.
#
# Checks 5 and 6 read every text file of the repository, not a list of documentation extensions:
# docs/adr/README.md states that code may reference an ADR number, so a verifier restricted to
# documentation file types would leave the references most likely to go stale — those in source
# comments, which no reviewer reads alongside the ADR index — unchecked. Check 4 stays on
# documentation file types on purpose: 'ADR-NNNN' means one thing wherever it appears, but '§' in
# source code is an ordinary character (see is_doc_file), and flagging it there would make a
# project's own string literals fail this repository's CI.
#
# Pure bash + coreutils/grep/sed/awk/find, plus git to enumerate the repository's files — all present
# in the Dev Container base image, so running it adds no toolchain and no dependency that would
# require an ADR. Check 15 additionally uses curl when it is available, and degrades to a skip when
# it is not.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/check-docs.sh [repository root]        (or: bash scripts/check-docs.sh)
# The root defaults to this repository; scripts/test-check-docs.sh passes fixture repositories.
# Exit code 0 when all checks pass, 1 otherwise. Warnings do not affect the exit code.
